Abdelzaher Professor and Willett Faculty Scholar Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign Urbana, IL 61801 Tel: (217) 265-6793 Fax: (217) 244-6500 I received my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, in 1999, under Professor Kang Shin . I was an Asistant Professor at the University of Virginia from August 1999 to August 2005. I then joined the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign as an Associate Professor with tenure, where I became Full Professor in 2011. My interests lie primarily in systems, including operating systems, networking, sensor networks, distributed systems, and embedded real-time systems. I am especially interested in developing theory, architectural support, and computing abstractions for predictability in software systems, motivated by the increasing software complexity and the growing sources of non-determinism. Applications range from sensor networks to large-scale server farms, and from transportation systems to medicine. New in Navigation: Green GPS . Brief Biosketch .

faculty	Sarita Adve University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Teaching Research Publications Students Contact Info for Students Fun Stuff Sarita V. Adve Richard T. Cheng Professor Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign sadve@illinois.edu Sarita V. Adve is the Richard T. Cheng Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . Her primary research interest is at the hardware-software interface with work spanning computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and applications. Her current research is on scalable system specialization and approximate computing. Sheco-developed the memory consistency models for the C++ and Java programming languages, which are based on her early work on data-race-free (DRF) models.More recently, her work questioned the conventional wisdom for memory models for heterogeneous systems and showed that DRF is a superior model even for such systems. She is also known for her contributions to cache coherence (she co-developed the simple and efficient DeNovo coherence protocol); hardware reliability (she co-developed software-driven approaches for hardware reliability in the SWAT project and the concept of lifetime reliability aware architectures and dynamic reliability management in the RAMP project); power management (she led the design of GRACE, one of the first systems to implement cross-layer energy management); exploiting instruction-level parallelism (ILP) for memory system performance (she co-authored some of the first papers on exploiting ILP for memory level parallelism); and evaluation techniques for shared-memory multiprocessors with ILP processors (she led the development of the RSIM architecture simulator). Professor Adve received the ACM/IEEE-CS Ken Kennedy award in 2018, was named a Woman of Vision in innovation by the Anita Borg Institute for Women in Technology in 2012, an IEEE fellow in 2012, an ACM fellow in 2010, received the ACM SIGARCH Maurice Wilkes award in 2008, an IBM faculty award in 2005, was named a UIUC University Scholar in 2004, received an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship in 1998, an IBM University Partnership award in 1997 and 1998, and a National Science Foundation CAREER award in 1995. For three of the last five years (2014-18), Illinois CS has selected her students'PhD theses as one of the department's two nominations for the ACM doctoral dissertation award. She currently serves as the chair of ACM SIGARCH , on the DARPA/ISAT study group, and on ACM Council. She previously served on the board of directors of the Computing Research Association (CRA) (2009-18), on the National Science Foundation's CISE directorate's advisory committee (2003-05), on the expert group to revise the Java memory model (2001-05), and co-led the Intel/Microsoft funded Universal Parallel Computing Research Center (UPCRC) at Illinois as its director of research in its founding year (2008-09). Professor Adve was the first woman of South Asian origin to be named fellow of the ACMand, as a Maurice Wilkes awardee, the first woman to receive a young-, mid-, or life-career award in computer architecture research. She is deeply committed to increasing the number of women in computing by influencing change that can enable more women to be successful at all stages of thecareer pipeline. She received the Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in 1993 and 1989 respectively, and the B.Tech. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay in 1987. Before joining Illinois, she was on the faculty at Rice University from 1993 to 1999.

Gillies Professor|Computer Science Department|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Research Projects Prof. Vikram Adve F ollow the individual project links for more details about each project and relevant publications: ALLVM: Exploring the benefits for software performance, security and reliability if all software on a system (either all userspace software or or userspace+OS software) is available in a rich virtual instruction set that can be analyzed and transformed by sophisticated compiler techniques (think Java bytecode, but for all software). Heterogeneous Parallel Virtual Machine : A compiler infrastructure and parallel program representationfor heterogeneous parallel systems, with the goal of making it much easier to write performance-portable parallel programs. A single program in the HPVM representation can be compiled to GPUsand tomulticore CPUs (with and without) vector extensions, while achieving performance close to separately hand-tuned code for each of those systems. The project is alsoexploring code generation for FPGAs, for specializeddeep-in-memory compute hardware, and developing optimizingcompilersforparallel languages like OpenMP and Domain Specific Languages. Automated Debugging for Software Failures : We are developing automated static and dynamic analysis techniques tounderstand the causes of failures in software systems, in order tohelp programmers diagnose and fix software bugs with as little effort as possible. The project is investigating automated fault localization and diagnosis techniques for both standalone and distributed programs. The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure : A novel virtual instruction set and compiler infrastructure that enables lifelong analysis and transformation of programs in arbitrary programming languages. LLVM is a key foundation for some of our other ongoing projects, including ALLVM and HPVM. Previous Projects Deterministic-by-default Parallel Programming : Language and compiler techniques to make parallel programming far easier than it is today, by enabling programmers to write provably deterministic parallel programs, and by enforcing that any non-deterministic behavior is made explicit and isolated. SVA: Secure Virtual Architecture : A compiler-based virtual machine for commodity operating systems that can greatly enhance the security and reliability of todays systems. SAFECode: Compiler techniques to enforce memory safety and other safety properties efficiently for unmodified C programs.

I am always looking for outstanding graduate or undergraduate students for the projects listed above. More than anything else, I am looking for students who are (a) creative andintellectually strong, and (b) ambitious and hard-working. I take on undergraduates, Masters (MS) students and Ph.D. students. I can generally give Research Assistantships only to Ph.D. students because our research funding is nearly always intended for long term research projects that require a sustained effort over several years. Note that if you join our group as a Ph.D. student, you should not expect to stop after 1.5 or 2 years with an MS degree: the research projects will generally not be appropriate for an MS thesis, which is relatively narrow research. I am willing to take on students interested in an MS for shorter term projects. An MS thesis nearly always must be publishable research, though in exceptional circumstances, I think an MS might be justified for development or experimental work that contributes significantly to one or more of our projects. I am always looking for outstanding undergraduate students interested in research and/or programming experience. I have taken on students ranging from seniors to freshmen: what I look for is someone with an interest in experimental software research, and the drive to work hard and succeed. If you fit these criteria, send me email with a subject line that has the prefix: [Prospective Student] Or, use this link to send me email just so I know you have read this (I am not filtering such email!). Include an up-to-date CV or resum, and say what degree you seek and what project(s) in our group interest you. I will contact you if I want to follow up . I get a lot of such email, so do not take it personally if I do not reply. Thanks for your interest! Log In

The main goal of this research is to develop a SoC real-time computing architecture that integrates hardware and software execution in a transparent manner, and can support QoS adaptation by means of partial reconfiguration of modern FPGA devices. CSR: Memory-Centric Real-Time Scheduling for Multicore Embedded Systems . M. Caccamo (PI), Co-PI: L. Sha , National Science Foundation, CNS-1219064 In modern automotive and avionics applications, the use of multiple sensors and especially real-time imaging sensors creates unprecedented workloads. From a computational perspective, multicore architectures have become mainstream; however, as a multicore chip is expected to process increasing volumes of data in real-time, the memory hierarchy becomes the bottleneck resource. In the worst case, task execution times can grow linearly with the number of cores in the system. This research aims at laying foundations for a modern memory-centric real-time scheduling theory that can effectively co-schedule the use of the memory hierarchy, the cores, and the on-chip network, including the I/O channels. According to the vision of Memory-Centric Scheduling, when the memory hierarchy is the system bottleneck, memory accesses should be scheduled to achieve high memory utilization. Performance of a real-time multicore system should be measured in terms of schedulable memory utilization rather than just core utilization. Ideally, the real-time constraints should be met as long as total memory utilization of all real-time applications (across all the cores contending for shared memory) is below 100%. See the presentation titled " The Migration of Safety-Critical RT Software to Multicore " ( pptx ) for learning about major findings of this research. CSR: Multicore Real Time Virtual Partitions . L. Sha (PI), Co-PIs: M. Caccamo, T. Abdelzaher, National Science Foundation, CNS-1302563 Embedded industry has a large body of certified real time safety and mission critical software developed for single core chips, using certification procedures developed for single core systems. Now, those chips are becoming obsolete, and newer chips are being designed with slower clock rates but multiple cores. Multicore computer platforms pose new challenges for hard real-time systems, because of the complex temporal coupling between processing cores' shared last level cache, shared memory and I/O bandwidth. This research aims at tackling this industry-wide challenge by introducing the notion of real time virtual partitions (RTVPs), each of which can be treated as a stand-alone single-core chip from the point of view of real-time schedulability analysis and certification process. Without a technology like RTVP, the change of workload in one core could adversely impact the schedulability of tasks in other cores, triggering the recertification of applications running on other cores. The time and costs of such recertification is economically unsustainable. This problem is especially critical for the avionic industry. Single Core Equivalence (SCE): a cost-effective solution for the transition of safety-critical RT software from single-core to multi-core commodity platforms. CPS: Breakthrough: Solar-powered, Long-endurance UAV for Real-time Onboard Data Processing . M. Caccamo (PI), National Science Foundation, CNS-1646383 Given the wide range of possibilities, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent a growing market in CPS and they are perceived as an "enabling technology" to re-consider the human involvement in many military and civil applications on a global scale. One of the major challenges in enabling this growth is UAV endurance. This is directly related to the amount of energy available to the UAV to perform its mission. This proposal looks to increase UAV endurance by trading off UAV performance with energy efficient computing. This requires mapping of mission and goals into energy needs and computational requirements. The goal of the project is to show that this trade can enable long-duration flight especially when solar energy is utilized as a primary energy source. The ambitious plan is to develop a light weight and efficient aircraft capable of maneuver-aware power adaptation and real-time video/sensor acquisition and processing for up to 12 hours of continuous flight (this limit being set by daylight hours). This project aims to expanding the theoretical and practical foundations for the design and integration of UAVs capable of real-time sensing and processing from an array of visual, acoustic and other sensors.

PI: Kevin C.C. Chang . News . Research. I lead the FORWARD Group , which is part of the larger Data and Information Systems Laboratories , at the CS department of UIUC. Our research overall aims at bridging structured and unstructured big data --- to bring structured/semantic-rich access to the myriad and massive unstructured data which accounts for most of the world's information. Therefore, o ur research spans across data mining, data management/databases , information retrieval, machine learning , with current efforts focusing on interactive data management , entity-centric Web search and mining , social media analytics, and social network mining . As our objectives, we aim at developing novel systems, principled algorithms, and formal theories that ultimately deliver real world applications. As our approaches, we seek to be inspired by and learn from the data we are tackling-- i.e., we believe the key to tame big data is to learn the wisdom hidden in the large scale of the data.

I have concentrated in two areas: the development of scalable numerical algorithms for partial differential equations (PDEs), especially for the linear systems that arise from approximations to PDEs, and the development of programming models and systems for expressing and implementing highly scalable applications. In each of these areas, I have led the development of software that has been widely adopted. PETSc is a powerful numerical library for the solution of linear and nonlinear systems of equations. MPI is the mostly widely used parallel programming system for large scale scientific computing. The MPICH implementation of MPI is one of the most widely used and is the implementation of choice for the world's fastest machines. A new interest is the development of a Deep Learning Major Research Instrument Project , which combines my interests in HPC software and numerics and high-performance I/O with the revolution in machine learning. Research Opportunities I have an active research program and currently have openings for graduate students, post docs, and scientific programmers.

Ensuring Tight Computational Security Against Higher-Order DPA Attacks PST 2011 Dakshita Khurana and Aditya Gaurav Research Overview: Within cryptography, my work designs secure protocols resisting active attacks while requiring minimal interaction. Some of my work [ KS17 , GKS16 ] has constructed protocols achieving security against man-in-the-middle attacks with minimal back-and-forth interaction, disproving and overcoming perceived impossibilities in the area. My work has also constructed non-interactive proof systems for NP achieving some desirable properties. Specifically, in [ JKKR17 ], we rely on well-studied assumptions to construct such proof systems achieving variants of zero-knowledge. These recently helped build other secure protocols with optimal interaction [ K17 , BGJKKS17 ]. In very recent work [ BKKSW17 ], we build succinct non-interactive proof systems for verifiably outsourcing non-deterministic computation with verification time growing only with the non-deterministic space complexity of computation, based for the first time on standard cryptographic assumptions. I have also worked on unconditionally secure computation using untrusted or leaky hardware, on differential privacy, and on program obfuscation.
faculty	Alex Kirlik Professor 4220 Siebel Center for Comp Sci 201 N. Goodwin Ave. Urbana Illinois 61801 (217) 244-8972 kirlik@illinois.edu : Primary Research Area Graphics, Visualization and HCI - Human-Computer Interaction Research Areas Human-Computer Interaction Visualization Biography Alex Kirlik is Professor in the Department of Computer Science with additional appointments in the Department of Industrial & Enterprise Systems Engineering, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, and the Information Trust Institute, the Coordinated Science Laboratory, the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory and the Illinois Informatics Institute. He previously served as acting head of Illinois's Human Factors program in the Institute of Aviation from 2006-2010. Alex earned his B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Industrial & Systems Engineering (Human-Machine Systems) at The Ohio State University. His Ph.D. thesis, "The organization of perception and action in complex control skills" earned the George Briggs Award from APA's Division of Applied Experimental and Engineering Psychologists, as the best dissertation of the year. During his academic career, in addition to positions held with his home institutions at the University of Illinois (2002-date) and Georgia Tech (1989-2001), Alex has held visiting positions at Stanford University and NASA Ames Research Center (ASEE-NASA Stanford Summer Faculty Fellow, 1989, 1990), Yale University, Haskins Laboratory and the University of Connecticut (Visiting Scholar, 2001-02 academic year), Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, MA (Sabbatical Research, 2012-13 academic year), and the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety (Visiting Scholar, summer 2015). Alex's research interests include human-computer interaction, human factors, visual analytics to support judgment and decision making, human-robot interaction, social computing, human-automation interaction and decision support is sociotechnical systems such as aviation, space, intelligence analysis, severe weather forecasting, disaster and emergency response, healthcare and medicine, autonomous vehicles, education and so forth. Alex's approach to teaching and mentoring students is naturally dependent of the level of instruction involved. Perhaps one notable aspect of his educational approach is that no crisp line can be drawn between his interests and activities in research and teaching. For example, he has advised 2 PhD dissertations on the development and evaluation of new techniques and technologies for teaching engineering design.His research and educational activities also dovetail in the realm of his graduate seminars, which are intensively group- and project-based, typically involving students in actual research projects to motivate and animate the course material. For example, in 2010 Alex seized on an opportunity afforded by a U.S. Challenge.gov Health and Human Services competition that required competing project teams to design a Facebook app that would be useful to people in the aftermath of natural disasters and emergencies. This project not only involved the students, working as a design team, to create a conceptual design for the app, but to also create a working software prototype and a video demo. The competition was open to any group who wanted to enter it was not specifically targeted to the educational community or to educational institutions. The students design earned 3rd place nationally. Education Ph.D. Industrial & Systems Engineering, The Ohio State University, 1989. . Research Statement Alex Kirliks research program in human-computer interaction, human factors, and cognitive science & engineering has focused on understanding and supporting the cognition (judgment, decision making, prediction, problem solving and system control), of professionals working in technological workplaces, operational contexts and sociotechnical systems. His research contributing to commercial aviation safety in both airborne and ground operations has been supported by NASA for over 25 years. Recently, aspects of these lines of research have matured into NSF- and NASA-sponsored multidisciplinary projects, joint with collaborators in aerospace, mechanical and software engineering, to create and evaluate formal techniques and general principles for the design of safe and robust cyber-physical-human systems comprised of people and hardware and software automation: Engineering Safety-Critical Cyber-Physical-Human (CPH) Systems. The aim of this research, which is relevant to applications not solely in aviation but in contexts such as healthcare and highways, is to achieve levels of human-automation system performance, robustness and safety exceeding what would be achievable by either a human or automation acting alone. A 5-minute public video demo illustrating this work in an aviation context is available at: www.youtube.com/watch . A second major thrust of Alex's research concerns support for judgment and decision making in high-stakes tasks. This line of research developed into an NSF-sponsored project to develop and evaluate quantitative models of judgment in technological systems (e.g., KIrlik, 2006, Adaptive Perspectives on Human-Technology Interaction , NY: Oxford; see: www.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780195171822/ ). Recently, Alex also participated in an IARPA-sponsored project to develop visual analytics to support intelligence analysts in forecasting world events: http://www.draper.com/news/draper-team-aims-improve-predictions-through-sp-de/?cc=us&lang=en&" , and most recently, he and his multi-disciplinary team began a 3-year research project involving the design and use of domestic, aerial and ground robotics to support aging-in-place called ASPIRE: Automation Supporting Prolonged Independent Residence for the Elderly, sponsored by the National Robotics Initiative. A brief video showing progress to date, presented at the October, 2016 "Aging 2.0" conference in San Francisco can be viewed at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoUvRaTnA8c#action=share" Also, Alex has co-edited (with J.D. Lee) the first authoritative handbook of its kind, The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Engineering (2013), representing the contributions of more than 60 of the disciplines most influential and accomplished researchers. He has been editor of the Oxford Series in Human-Technology Interaction for Oxford University Press for more than 10 years, a series that includes more than a dozen scholarly books and edited volumes by prominent researchers published to date: https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/h/human-technology-interaction-series-hti/?cc=us&lang=en& Undergraduate Research Opportunities Alex often has paid or for-credit undergraduate research opportunities in both human-computer interaction and human factors.

faculty	Ranjitha Kumar RANJITHA@ILLINOIS.EDU Curriculum Vitae SIEBEL 4224 FALL 2017 OH: WED 1-2PM I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and (by courtesy) the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . I run the Data Driven Design Group , where my students and I leverage data mining and machine learning to address the central challenge of creating good user experiences: tying design decisions to desired outcomes. I received my PhD from the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University , where I worked with Scott Klemmer . I was formerly the Chief Scientist at Apropose, Inc., a data-driven design company I co-founded, which was backed by Andreessen Horowitz and New Enterprise Associates . SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Learning Design Semantics for Mobile Apps Thomas F. Liu, Mark Craft, Jason Situ, Ersin Yumer, Radomir Mech, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '18 Recently, researchers have developed black-box approaches to mine design and interaction data from mobile apps. Although the data captured during this interaction mining is descriptive, it does not expose the design semantics of UIs: what elements on the screen mean and how they are used. This paper introduces an automatic approach for generating semantic annotations for mobile app UIs. Through an iterative open coding of 73k UI elements and 720 screens, we contribute a lexical database of 25 types of UI components, 197 text button concepts, and 135 icon classes shared across apps. We use this labeled data to learn code-based patterns to detect UI components and to train a convolutional neural network that distinguishes between icon classes with 94% accuracy. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach at scale, we compute semantic annotations for the 72k unique UIs in the Rico dataset, assigning labels for 78% of the total visible, non-redundant elements. Learning Type-Aware Embeddings for Fashion Compatibility Mariya I. Vasileva, Bryan A. Plummer, Krishna Dusad, Shreya Rajpal, Ranjitha Kumar, and David Forsyth Proceedings of ECCV '18 Outfits in online fashion data are composed of items of many different types (e.g. top, bottom, shoes) that share some stylistic relationship with one another. A representation for building outfits requires a method that can learn both notions of similarity (for example, when two tops are interchangeable) and compatibility (items of possibly different type that can go together in an outfit). This paper presents an approach to learning an image embedding that respects item type, and jointly learns notions of item similarity and compatibility in an end-to-end model. To evaluate the learned representation, we crawled 68,306 outfits created by users on the Polyvore website. Our approach obtains 3-5% improvement over the state-of-the-art on outfit compatibility prediction and fill-in-the-blank tasks using our dataset, as well as an established smaller dataset, while supporting a variety of useful queries. Designing the Future of Personal Fashion Kristen Vaccaro, Tanvi Agarwalla, Sunaya Shivakumar, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of CHI '18 Advances in computer vision and machine learning are changing the way people dress, and buy clothes. Given the vast space of fashion problems, where can data-driven technologies provide the most value? To understand consumer pain points and opportunities for technological interventions, this paper presents the results from two independent need-finding studies that explore the gold-standard of personalized shopping: interacting with a personal stylist. Through interviews with five personal stylists, we study the range of problems they address and their in-person processes for working with clients. In a separate study, we investigate how styling experiences map to online settings by building and releasing a chatbot that connects users to one-on-one sessions with a stylist, acquiring more than 70 organic users in three weeks. These conversations reveal that in-person and online styling sessions share similar goals, but online sessions often involve smaller problems that can be resolved more quickly. Based on these explorations, we propose future personalized, online interactions that address consumer trust and uncertainty, and discuss opportunities for automation. ZIPT: Zero-Integration Performance Testing of Mobile App Designs Biplab Deka, Zifeng Huang, Chad Franzen, Jeffrey Nichols, Yang Li, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '17 To evaluate the performance of mobile app designs, designers and researchers employ techniques such as A/B, usability, and analytics-driven testing. While these are all useful strategies for evaluating known designs, comparing many divergent solutions to identify the most performant remains a costly and difficult problem. This paper introduces a design performance testing approach that leverages existing app implementations and crowd workers to enable comparative testing at scale. This approach is manifest in ZIPT, a zero-integration performance testing platform that allows designers to collect detailed design and interaction data over any Android app including apps they do not own and did not build. Designers can deploy scripted tests via ZIPT to collect aggregate user performance metrics (e.g., completion rate, time on task) and qualitative feedback over third-party apps. Through case studies, we demonstrate that designers can use ZIPTs aggregate data and visualizations to understand the relative performance of interaction patterns found in the wild, and identify usability issues in existing Android apps. Rico: A Mobile App Dataset for Building Data-Driven Design Applications Biplab Deka, Zifeng Huang, Chad Franzen, Joshua Hibschman, Daniel Afergan, Yang Li, Jeffrey Nichols, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '17 Data-driven models help mobile app designers understand best practices and trends, and can be used to make predictions about design performance and support the creation of adaptive UIs. This paper presents Rico, the largest repository of mobile app designs to date, created to support five classes of data-driven applications: design search, UI layout generation, UI code generation, user interaction modeling, and user perception prediction. To create Rico, we built a system that combines crowdsourcing and automation to scalably mine design and interaction data from Android apps at runtime. The Rico dataset contains design data from more than 9.7k Android apps spanning 27 categories. It exposes visual, textual, structural, and interactive design properties of more than 72k unique UI screens. To demonstrate the kinds of applications that Rico enables, we present results from training an autoencoder for UI layout similarity, which supports query-by-example search over UIs. Identifying Fashion Accounts in Social Networks Doris Jung-Lin Lee, Jinda Han, Dana Chambourova, and Ranjitha Kumar KDD Workshop on ML Meets Fashion '17 Fashion and style are characterized by the ebb and flow of trends. With the rise of social media, fashion blogs, and the fast-fashion movement, bottom-up fashion trends are emerging at an ever-increasing rate. Recognizing these trends as they happen --- and the influencers that create them --- is challenging for retailers and consumers alike. As a first step, this paper presents a classifier for identifying fashion-related accounts on social media. To develop this classifier, we created a dataset of 10k Twitter accounts from crawling the set of users followed by ten prominent fashion accounts, and crowdsourced ground-truth labels for them. Based on this training data and a set of content-based features, we trained a classifier that identfies whether or not a Twitter account is fashion-related. In the future, we hope to leverage this classifier to identify key fashion influencers and conduct large-scale monitoring of fashion trends. An Experimentation Engine for Data-Driven Fashion Systems Ranjitha Kumar and Kristen Vaccaro Proceedings of AAAI Symposium on UX of ML '17 Data-driven fashion systems of the future will revolutionize the way consumers shop for clothing and choose outfits: imagine an automated personal stylist that ships clothes straight to your door based on their compatibility with your existing wardrobe, the upcoming events on your calendar, and style trends learned from the web. To build such systems, we must identify the fashion activities that are the largest consumer pain points, the interventions necessary to alleviate those pains, and the computational models that enable those interventions. To guide the design of these next-generation tools, we propose an experimentation engine for fashion interfaces: leveraging social media platforms to run multivariate design tests with thousands to millions of users. Social platforms are already home to dedicated communities of fashion enthusiasts, and expose programmable agents --- chatbots --- that can be used to rapidly prototype data-driven design interfaces. Measuring the number of followers and user engagement amongst these prototypes can inform the design of future standalone fashion systems. At this workshop, we will sketch the design space of fashion experiments, and present preliminary results from deploying our fashion bots. ERICA: Interaction Mining For Mobile Apps Biplab Deka, Zifeng Huang, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '16 Design plays an important role in adoption of apps. App design, however, is a complex process with multiple design activities. To enable data-driven app design applications, we present interaction mining --- capturing both static (UI layouts, visual details) and dynamic (user flows, motion details) components of an app's design. We present ERICA, a system that takes a scalable, human-computer approach to interaction mining existing Android apps without the need to modify them in any way. As users interact with apps through ERICA, it detects UI changes, seamlessly records multiple data-streams in the background, and unifies them into a user interaction trace. Using ERICA we collected interaction traces from over a thousand popular Android apps. Leveraging this trace data, we built machine learning classifiers to detect elements and layouts indicative of 23 common user flows. User flows are an important component of UX design and consists of a sequence of UI states that represent semantically meaningful tasks such as searching or composing. With these classifiers, we identified and indexed more than 3000 flow examples, and released the largest online search engine of user flows in Android apps. The Elements of Fashion Style Kristen Vaccaro, Sunaya Shivakumar, Ziqiao Ding, Karrie Karahalios, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '16 The outfits people wear contain latent fashion concepts capturing styles, seasons, events, and environments. Fashion theorists have proposed that these concepts are shaped by design elements such as color, material, and silhouette. A dress may be bohemian because of its pattern, material, trim, or some combination of them: it is not always clear how low-level elements translate to high-level styles. In this paper, we use polylingual topic modeling to learn latent fashion concepts jointly in two languages capturing these elements and styles. Using this latent topic formation we can translate between these two languages through topic space, exposing the elements of fashion style. We train the polylingual topic model (PLTM) on a set of more than half a million outfits collected from Polyvore, a popular fashion-based social network. We present novel, data-driven fashion applications that allow users to express their needs in natural language just as they would to a real stylist and produce tailored item recommendations for these style needs. Learning Interpretable Musical Compositional Rules and Traces Haizi Yu, Lav R. Varshney, Guy E. Garnett, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of ICML WHI '16 Throughout music history, theorists have identified and documented interpretable rules that capture the decisions of composers. This paper asks, Can a machine behave like a music theorist? It presents MUS-ROVER, a self-learning system for automatically discovering rules from symbolic music. MUS-ROVER performs feature learning via n-gram models to extract compositional rules --- statistical patterns over the resulting features. We evaluate MUS-ROVER on Bachs (SATB) chorales, demonstrating that it can recover known rules, as well as identify new, characteristic patterns for further study. We discuss how the extracted rules can be used in both machine and human composition. Accounting for Taste: Ranking Curators and Content in Social Networks Haizi Yu, Biplab Deka, Jerry O. Talton, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of CHI '16 Ranking users in social networks is a well-studied problem, typically solved by algorithms that leverage network structure to identify influential users and recommend people to follow. In the last decade, however, curation --- users sharing and promoting content in a network --- has become a central social activity, as platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and GitHub drive growth and engagement by connecting users through content and content to users. While existing algorithms reward users that are highly active with higher rankings, they fail to account for users' curatorial taste. This paper introduces CuRank, an algorithm for ranking users and content in social networks by explicitly modeling three characteristics of a good curator: discerning taste, high activity, and timeliness. We evaluate CuRank on datasets from two popular social networks --- GitHub and Vine --- and demonstrate its efficacy at ranking content and identifying good curators. What Makes a Brand Look Expensive? Jingxian Zhang, Neel Kothari, Asad Butt, and Ranjitha Kumar Extended Abstracts of CHI '16 Branding is a powerful tool that companies use to control the perception of their products' quality and price. A company's website is a digital vehicle for conveying this brand information. The look and feel of a website often influence a customer's impression of a brand's price category. To understand what makes a brand look expensive, we evaluate the website designs of two industries --- watches and cars. We ran a crowdsourced study to collect ratings of perceived cost based on web page screenshots. By training a random forest regression model over these ratings, we learned which visual features of website design are predictive of perceived cost. Webzeitgeist: Design Mining the Web Ranjitha Kumar, Arvind Satyanarayan, Cesar Torres, Maxine Lim, Salman Ahmad, Scott R. Klemmer, and Jerry O. Talton Proceedings of CHI '13 BEST PAPER AWARD Advances in data mining and knowledge discovery have transformed the way Web sites are designed. However, while visual presentation is an intrinsic part of the Web, traditional data mining techniques ignore render-time page structures and their attributes. This paper introduces design mining for the Web: using knowledge discovery techniques to understand design demographics, automate design curation, and support data-driven design tools. This idea is manifest in Webzeitgeist, a platform for large-scale design mining comprising a repository of over 100,000 Web pages and 100 million design elements. This paper describes the principles driving design mining, the implementation of the Webzeitgeist architecture, and the new class of data-driven design applications it enables. Learning Structural Semantics for the Web Maxine Lim, Ranjitha Kumar, Arvind Satyanarayan, Cesar Torres, Jerry O. Talton, and Scott R. Klemmer Stanford University CSTR 2012-03 Researchers have long envisioned a Semantic Web, where unstructured Web content is replaced by documents with rich semantic annotations. Unfortunately, this vision has been hampered by the difficulty of acquiring semantic metadata for Web pages. This paper introduces a method for automatically 'semantifying' structural page elements: using machine learning to train classifiers that can be applied in a post-hoc fashion. We focus on one popular class of semantic identifiers: those concerned with the structureor information architectureof a page. To determine the set of structural semantics to learn and to collect training data for the learning, we gather a large corpus of labeled page elements from a set of online workers. We discuss the results from this collection and demonstrate that our classifiers learn structural semantics in a general way. Learning Design Patterns with Bayesian Grammar Induction Jerry O. Talton, Lingfeng Yang, Ranjitha Kumar, Maxine Lim, Noah D. Goodman, and Radomr Mch Proceedings of UIST '12 BEST PAPER NOMINEE Design patterns have proven useful in many creative fields, providing content creators with archetypal, reusable guidelines to leverage in projects. Creating such patterns, however, is a time-consuming, manual process, typically relegated to a few experts in any given domain. In this paper, we describe an algorithmic method for learning design patterns directly from data using techniques from natural language processing and structured concept learning. Given a set of labeled, hierarchical designs as input, we induce a probabilistic formal grammar over these exemplars. Once learned, this grammar encodes a set of generative rules for the class of designs, which can be sampled to synthesize novel artifacts. We demonstrate the method on geometric models and Web pages, and discuss how the learned patterns can drive new interaction mechanisms for content creators. Data-Driven Web Design Ranjitha Kumar, Jerry O. Talton, Salman Ahmad, and Scott R. Klemmer Proceedings of ICML '12 INVITED APPLICATIONS PAPER This short paper summarizes challenges and opportunities of applying machine learning methods to Web design problems, and describes how structured prediction, deep learning, and probabilistic program induction can enable useful interactions for designers. We intend for these techniques to foster new work in data-driven Web design. Flexible Tree Matching Ranjitha Kumar, Jerry O. Talton, Salman Ahmad, Tim Roughgarden, and Scott R. Klemmer Proceedings of IJCAI '11 INVITED PAPER Tree-matching problems arise in many computational domains. The literature provides several methods for creating correspondences between labeled trees; however, by definition, tree-matching algorithms rigidly preserve ancestry. That is, once two nodes have been placed in correspondence, their descendants must be matched as well. We introduce flexible tree matching, which relaxes this rigid requirement in favor of a tunable formulation in which the role of hierarchy can be controlled. We show that flexible tree matching is strongly NP-complete, give a stochastic approximation algorithm for the problem, and demonstrate how structured prediction techniques can learn the algorithm's parameters from a set of example matchings. Finally, we present results from applying the method to tasks in Web design. Bricolage: Example-Based Retargeting for Web Design Ranjitha Kumar, Jerry O. Talton, Salman Ahmad, and Scott R. Klemmer Proceedings of CHI '11 BEST PAPER AWARD The Web provides a corpus of design examples unparalleled in human history. However, leveraging existing designs to produce new pages is often difficult. This paper introduces the Bricolage algorithm for transferring design and content between Web pages. Bricolage employs a novel, structured-prediction technique that learns to create coherent mappings between pages by training on human-generated exemplars. The produced mappings are then used to automatically transfer the content from one page into the style and layout of another. We show that Bricolage can learn to accurately reproduce human page mappings, and that it provides a general, efficient, and automatic technique for retargeting content between a variety of real Web pages. Designing with Interactive Example Galleries Brian Lee, Savil Srivastava, Ranjitha Kumar, Ronen Brafman, and Scott R Klemmer Proceedings of CHI '10 Designers often use examples for inspiration; examples offer contextualized instances of how form and content integrate. Can interactive example galleries bring this practice to everyday users doing design work, and does working with examples help the designs they create? This paper explores whether people can realize significant value from explicit mechanisms for designing by example modification. We present the results of three studies, finding that independent raters prefer designs created with the aid of examples, that users prefer adaptively selected examples to random ones, and that users make use of multiple examples when creating new designs. To enable these studies and demonstrate how software tools can facilitate designing with examples, we introduce interface techniques for browsing and borrowing from a corpus of examples, manifest in the Adaptive Ideas Web design tool. Adaptive Ideas leverages a faceted metadata interface for viewing and navigating example galleries.

Note: In Computer Science, publications at top-ranking conferences are considered more important and prestigious than journals (of course they have their place as well). Here is an official memo from the Computing Research Association (CRA) stating that fact. Some systems/real-time conference rankings: 1 , 2 , 3 . Of course, these not authoritative and not in any order, and they seem to have a slight bias towards US-based conferences. . Behavior-Based Intrusion Detection Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) have distinct cyber and physical components that must work cohesivelywith each other to ensure correct operation. Examples include automobiles, power plants,avionics systems, home automation systems, etc. Traditionally such systems were isolated from externalaccesses and used proprietary components and protocols. Hence, they were considered tobe invulnerable to cyber attacks. The recent Stuxnet worm and other similar attacks have shownthat even such systems are not immune to compromise. A failure to protect these systems fromharm could result in significant harm to humans, the environment or even critical infrastructure. On the other hand, many cyber-physical systems have real-time constraints i.e., they must functioncorrectly within predetermined time scales. Systems that have such real-time properties are predictable by design . Designers work really hard to ensure that the execution behavior of such systems(e.g., execution time, memory usage, control flow, system properties, etc.) are analyzed andcontrolled to a high level of detail so as to guarantee predictable behavior. This project aims to use this very predictability of real-time CPS to detect intrusions as soon asthey occur and take evasive actions . This will be then combined with the development of an architecturalframework to: detect intrusions and guarantee that the underlying physical systemdoes not come to harm . The development of analysis techniques and intrusion-detection architectures will inherently make such systems more secure and hence, safer. It will bring us one stepcloser to understanding how to integrate two seemingly diverse yet important fields, CPS andsecurity, while gaining a better understanding of both areas. The ideas that will be developed as part of this project have the potential for significant impact ona diverse set of domains. Apart from the research community, government agencies and industrycould also gain significantly from results produced as part of this research. It will make manycritical aspects of modern day life such as aircraft, vehicles, critical infrastructures (power grid,water treatment plants, etc.) much safer.

Integrating Security in Real-Time Embedded Systems Embedded real-time systems (RTS) are used to monitor and control physical systems and processes in varied domains. Formerly, most such systems remained isolated from the rest of the world, and applications were partitioned in isolated processing nodes that offered protection from cyber-attacks. Increasingly, these systems are now being connected together, and there does not exist a comprehensive framework for integrating security into embedded RTS; retrofitting existing systems is usually ineffective. Traditionally, real-time systems are modeled as sets of periodic tasks that are then scheduled on a collection of resources. Any security-related mechanisms must work within the imposed restrictions of real-time systems; on the other hand, those properties of RTS make it easier to model systems and perform rigorous analysis of developed solutions. This project is aimed at developing (1) an understanding of threat landscapes; (2) security mechanisms that are unique to this domain; and (3) theories, policies, models, algorithms, and mechanisms that bring the domains of security and real-time systems together. The work is answering questions such as: when solutions are developed that integrate security with real-time systems theory, can we classify solutions based on how effectively they meet real-time requirements as well as improve system security? Can this be used to aid in development of robust systems that can monitor themselves and detect events?

In initial work, we have been able to cast certain security properties (viz. information leakage) as constraints for fixed-priority real-time schedulers. Using traditional schedulability and response-time analysis we have been able to show the effects of such methods. Designers of real-time systems can now decide on how much security (i.e. protection against information leakage) they can tolerate in comparison to the real-time requirements.

Real-Time Systems A real-time system is is defined as a system that has both : Logical, and Temporal correctness. The temporal correctness is defined in the form of a constraint, usually termed as deadline . The usefulness of results produced by the system drops significantly, at times, to zero, on the passing of this constraint. Real-time systems are broadly classified into the following categories : Hard : The usefulness of results on the passing of the contraint falls sharply and missing such constraints could lead to catastrophic effects to the system, then user, the environment, or all of them. Eg. : ABS system in cars, safety control of nuclear reactors, etc. Soft : The usefulness of results falls gradually, on the passing of the constraint, and a few missed deadlines can be tolerated by the system, without catastrophic results. Eg. : MPEG decoding of streaming video. A real-time system is defined as a collection of tasks , each of which is defined as : {phi, p, e, d} , where : phi : phase p : period e : worst-case execution time of the task - the guaranteed upper bound on execution time of the task, for all possible inputs. d : temporal constraint, deadline. Real-time systems theory reasons about the schedulability of task sets i.e. , offline schedulability tests, which can determine if all deadlines of a set of tasks can be met. Task parameters have to be known beforehand, i.e ., parameters such as period of each task, the worst-case execution time (WCET), and so on. Periods of tasks are determined from the operating environment, such as temporal constraints on sensors, actuators and other parts of the system. Determining the WCET for tasks is a non-trivial effort due to software complexity, non-determinism of inputs and hardware complexity with unpredictable execution behavior. . Publication: Rapid Early-Phase Virtual Integration Authors : Sibin Mohan , Min-Young Nam , Rodolfo Pellizzoni , Lui Sha , Richard Bradford and Shana Fliginger. Abstract : In complex hard real-time systems with tight constraints on system resources, small changes in one component of a system can cause a cascade of adverse effects on other parts of the system. We address the inherent complexity of making architectural decisions by raising the level of abstraction at which the analysis is performed. Our analysis approach gives the system architect a rigorous method for quickly determining which system architectures should be pursued, and it allows the architect to track and manage the cascading effects of subsystem/component changes in a comprehensive, quantitative manner. The end product is a virtual architecture analysis that systematically incorporates the inherent coupling among interacting system components that share limited system resources. Here is a link to the full paper and slides to the talk at RTSS. This was presented at the IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium ( RTSS ) , held in Washington DC in December 2009 . . Publication : CheckerCore: Enhancing an FPGA Soft Core to Capture Worst-Case Execution Times Authors : Jin Ouyang , Raghuveer Raghavendra, Sibin Mohan , Tao Zhang , Yuan Xie and Frank Mueller . Abstract : Embedded processors have become increasingly complex, resulting in variable execution behavior and reduced timing predictability. On such processors, safe timing specifications expressed as bounds on the worst-case execution time (WCET) are generally too loose due to conservative assumptions about complex architectural features, timing anomalies and programmatic complexities. Hence, exploiting the latest architectures may not be an option for embedded systems with hard real-time constraints where deadline misses cannot be tolerated. This work addresses these shortcomings by contributing CheckerCore. CheckerCore is a mode-enhanced SPARC v8 soft core processor synthesized on an FPGA. During regular execution the core adheres to its original specifications. But when operating in a special time-checking configuration, CheckerCore executes programs irrespective of inputs and steers execution along selected control flow paths. Such execution allows systematic derivation of worst-case execution time (WCET) bounds. This paper presents the design and implementation of CheckerCore and illustrates its use in deriving accurate WCET bounds for a set of embedded benchmarks. Overall, CheckerCore proposes a realistic processor core enhancement that encapsulate processor details without revealing them to users while supporting safe bounding of WCETs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first contribution of a WCET-enhancing microarchitectural feature besides full processor encapsulations.

Publication : Push-Assisted Migration of Real-Time Tasks in Multi-Core Processors Authors : Abhik Sarkar, Frank Mueller , Harini Ramaprasad and Sibin Mohan . Abstract : Multicores are becoming ubiquitous, not only in general-purpose but also embedded computing. This trend is a reflection of contemporary embedded applications posing steadily increasing demands in processing power. On such platforms, prediction of timing behavior to ensure that deadlines of real-time tasks can be met is becoming increasingly difficult. While real-time multicore scheduling approaches help to assure deadlines based on firm theoretical properties, their reliance on task migration poses a significant challenge to timing predictability in practice. Task migration actually (a) reduces timing predictability for contemporary multicores due to cache warm-up overheads while (b) increasing traffic on the network-on-chip (NoC) interconnect. This paper puts forth a fundamentally new approach to increase the timing predictability of multicore architectures aimed at task migration in embedded environments. A task migration between two cores imposes cache warm-up overheads on the migration target, which can lead to missed deadlines for tight real-time schedules.We propose novel micro-architectural support to migrate cache lines. Our scheme shows dramatically increased predictability in the presence of cross-core migration. Experimental results for schedules demonstrate that our scheme enables real-time tasks to meet their deadlines in the presence of task migration. Our results illustrate that increases in execution time due to migration is reduced by our scheme to levels that may prevent deadline misses of real-time tasks that would otherwise occur. Our mechanism imposes an overhead at a fraction of the tasks execution time, yet this overhead can be steered to fill idle slots in the schedule, i.e., it does not contribute to the execution time of the migrated task. Overall, our novel migration scheme provides a unique mechanism capable of significantly increasing timing predictability in the wake of task migration.

Ph.D. Thesis : Exploiting Hardware/Software Interactions for Analyzing Embedded Systems Author : Sibin Mohan Abstract : Em bedded systems are often subject to real-time timing constraints. Such systems require determinism to ensure that task deadlines are met. The knowledge of the bounds on worst-case execution times (WCET) of tasks is a critical piece of information required to achieve this objective. One limiting factor in designing real-time systems is the class of processors that may be used. Contemporary processors with their advanced architectural features, such as out-of-order execution, branch prediction, speculation, and prefetching, cannot be statically analyzed to obtain WCETs for tasks as they introduce non-determinism into task execution, which can only be resolved at run-time. Such micro-processors are tuned to reduce average-case execution times at the expense of predictability. Hence, they do not find use in hard real-time systems. On the other hand, static timing analysis derives bounds on WCETs but requires that bounds on loop iterations be known statically, i.e., at compile time. This limits the class of applications that may be analyzed by static timing analysis and, hence, used in a real-time system. Finally, many embedded systems have communication and/or synchronization constructs and need to function on a wide spectrum of hardware devices ranging from small micro-controllers to modern multi-core architectures. Hence, any single analysis technique (be it static or dynamic) will not suffice in gauging the true nature of such systems. This thesis contributes novel techniques that use combinations of analysis methods and constant interactions between them to tackle complexities in modern embedded systems. To be more specific, this thesis (I) introduces of a new paradigm that proposes minor enhancements to modern processor architectures, which, on interaction with software modules, is able to obtain tight, accurate timing analysis results for modern processors; (II) it shows how the constraint concerning statically bound loops may be relaxed and applied to make dynamic decisions at run-time to achieve power savings; (III) it represents the temporal behavior of distributed real-time applications as colored graphs coupled with graph reductions/transformations that attempt to capture inherent meaning in the application. To the best of my knowledge, these methods that utilize interactions between different sources of information to analyze modern embedded systems are a first of their kind.

Publication : Merging State and Preserving Timing Anomalies in Pipelines of High-End Processors Authors : Sibin Mohan and Frank Mueller . Abstract : Many embedded systems are subject to temporal constraints that require advance guarantees on meeting deadlines. Such systems rely on static analysis to safely bound worst-case execution (WCET) bounds of tasks. Designers of these systems are forced to avoid state-of-the-art processors due to their inherent architectural complexity (such as out-of-order instruction scheduling) that results in non-determinism. This work addresses this problem by providing novel pipeline analysis techniques for characterizing the worst-case behavior of real-time systems on modern processor architectures. We introduce methods to capture (snapshot) pipeline state and to subsequently perform a merge of previously captured snapshots. We prove that our pipeline analysis correctly preserves worst-case timing behavior on OOO processor pipelines. We further specifically show that anomalous pipeline effects, effectively dilating timing, are preserved by our method. To the best of our knowledge, this method of pipeline analysis and interactions between hardware/software for obtaining WCET bounds on OOO processors is the first of its kind.

Publication : Hybrid Timing Analysis of Modern Processor Pipelines via Hardware/Software Interactions Authors : Sibin Mohan and Frank Mueller . Abstract : Embedded systems are often subject to constraints that require determinism to ensure that task deadlines are met. Such systems are referred to as real-time systems. Schedulability analysis provides a firm basis to ensure that tasks meet their deadlines for which knowledge of worst-case execution time (WCET) bounds is a critical piece of information. Static timing analysis techniques are used to derive these WCET bounds. A limiting factor for designing real-time systems is the class of processors that can be used. Typically, modern, complex processor pipelines cannot be used in real-time systems design. Contemporary processors with their advanced architectural features, such as out-of-order execution, branch prediction, speculation, prefetching, etc., cannot be statically analyzed to obtain tight WCET bounds for tasks. The main reason is that these features introduce non-determinism to task execution that surfaces in full only at runtime. In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm to perform timing analysis of tasks for real-time systems running on modern processor architectures. We propose minor enhancements to the processor architecture to enable this process. These features, on interaction with software modules, are able to obtain tight, accurate timing analysis results for modern processors. We also briefly present analysis techniques that, combined with our timing analysis methods, reduce the complexity of worst-case estimations for loops. To the best of our knowledge, this method of constant interactions between hardware and software to calculate WCET bounds for out-of-order processors is the first of its kind.

Publication : Temporal Analysis for Adapting Concurrent Applications to Embedded Systems Authors : Sibin Mohan and Johannes Helander . Abstract : Embedded services and applications that interact with the real world often, over time, need to run on different kinds of hardware which range in capability from low-cost microcontrollers with very limited memory to powerful multicore processors. It is quite difficult to write one program that would work reliably on such a wide range of devices. This is especially true when the application must be temporally predictable and robust which should usually be the case since the physical world works in real-time. Thus, any application interacting with such a system, distributed or not, must also work in real-time. In this paper we introduce a representation of the temporal behavior of an application as a colored graph that captures the timing of temporally continuous sections of execution, called bars, and the dependencies between the bars, creating a partial order. We then introduce a method of extracting the graph from existing applications using a combination of static, dynamic and other analyses. Once the graph has been created we employ a number of graph transformations, introduced here, that extract ``meaning'' from the graph. The knowledge gained can be utilized for scheduling and by the programmer for adjusting the level of parallelism suitable to the specific hardware, for identifying hot spots, false parallelism, or even candidates for additional concurrency. Graphs can be serialized to a partiture that can be used as input for offline, online, or even distributed real-time scheduling. Finally we present results from a prototype analyzer that was used on a complete TCP/IP stack in addition to smaller test applications. The most surprising outcome is that increasing the expression of concurrency can reduce the level of parallelism required, saving memory on deeply embedded platforms.

Abstract : Deeply embedded systems often have unique constraints because of their small size and vital roles in critical infrastructure. Problems include limitations on code size, limited access to the actual hardware, {\em etc.} These problems become more critical in real-time systems where security policies must not only work within the above limitations but also ensure that task deadlines are not missed. A critical piece of information for security policies in real-time systems is the worst-case execution time (WCET) of the security code. This paper addresses some of the issues faced in the implementation of such security policies and also the process of determining WCETs for them. analysis safely bounds worst-case execution times to determine if tasks can meet their deadlines in hard real-time systems. However, conventional timing analysis requires that the upper bound of loops be known statically, which limits its applicability. Parametric timing analysis methods remove this constraint by providing the WCET as a formula parameterized on loop bounds.

Publication : Parametric Timing Analysis and its Application to DVS Authors : Sibin Mohan , Frank Mueller , William Hawkins , Michael Root , Christopher Healy , David Whalley and Emilio Vivancos . Abstract : Embedded Systems with real-time constraints depend on a-priori knowledge of worst-case execution times (WCETs) to determine if tasks meet deadlines. Static timing analysis derives bounds on WCETs but requires statically known loop bounds. This work removes the constraints on known loop bounds through parametric analysis expressing WCETs as functions. Tighter WCETs are dynamically discovered to exploit slack by dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) saving 60%-80% energy over DVS-oblivious techniques and showing savings close to more costly dynamic-priority DVS algorithms. Overall, parametric analysis expands the class of real-time applications to programs with loop-invariant dynamic loop bounds while retaining tight WCET bounds. Here is a link to the full paper .

Publication : ParaScale: Exploiting Parametric Timing Analysis for Real-Time Schedulers and Dynamic Voltage Scaling Authors : Sibin Mohan , Frank Mueller , William Hawkins , Michael Root , Christopher Healy and David Whalley . Abstract : Static timing analysis safely bounds worst-case execution times to determine if tasks can meet their deadlines in hard real-time systems. However, conventional timing analysis requires that the upper bound of loops be known statically, which limits its applicability. Parametric timing analysis methods remove this constraint by providing the WCET as a formula parameterized on loop bounds. This paper contributes a novel technique to allow parametric timing analysis to interact with dynamic real-time schedulers. By dynamically detecting actual loop bounds, a lower WCET bound can be calculated, on-the-fly, for the remaining execution of a task. We analyze thebenefits from parametric analysis in terms of dynamically discovered slack in a schedule. We then assess the potential for dynamic power conservation by exploiting parametric loop bounds for ParaScale, our intra-task dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) approach. Our results demonstrate that the parametric approach to timing analysis provides significant savings, close to 66 \%, in terms of slack as well as power. We further show that using this approach combined with online intra-task DVS to exploit parametric execution times results in much lower power consumption. Hence, even in the absence of dynamic scheduling, significant savings in power can be obtained, e.g. ,in the case of cyclic executives.

Publication : Timing Analysis for Sensor Network Nodes of the Atmega Processor Family. Authors : Sibin Mohan , Frank Mueller , David Whalley and Christopher Healy . Abstract : Low-end embedded architectures, such as sensor nodes, have become popular in diverse fields, many of which impose real-time constraints. Currently, the Atmel Atmega processor family used by Berkeley Motes lacks support for deriving safe bounds on the WCET, which is a prerequisite for performing real-time schedulability analysis. Our work fills this gap by providing an analytical method to obtain WCET bounds for this processor architecture. Our first contribution is to analyze both C and NesC code, the latter of which is unprecedented. The second contribution is to model control hazards and variable-cycle instructions, both handled more efficiently by our approach than by previous ones and results in up to 77% improvement in bounding the WCET. The results demonstrate that our timing analysis framework is able to tightly and safely estimate the WCET of the benchmarks while simulator results are shown to not always provide safe WCET bounds. While motivated by the Atmel Atmega series of processors, results are equally applicable to low-end embedded processors. This work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first set of experiments where timing results are contrasted from execution on an actual processor, from a cycle-accurate simulator and from a static timing analyzer. Furthermore, making our timing analysis toolset available to the Atmel Atmega processor family is a significant contribution towards addressing a documented need for tool support for sensor node architectures commonly used in networked systems of embedded computers, or so-called EmNets.

faculty	Cyber Physical Systems Integration Lab Search Main menu Skip to primary content News Research Past Sponsors People About History and Accomplishments Internal Lui Sha http://cs.illinois.edu/people/faculty/lui-sha Lui Sha graduated with Phd. from CMU in 1985. He worked at the Software Engineering Institute from 1986 to 1998. He joined UIUC in 1998. Currently, he is Donald B. Gillies Chair Professor of Computer Science, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He was named Tau Beta Pi Daniel C. Drucker Eminent Faculty in 2017.He is a Fellow of ACM and IEEE and a recipient of IEEEs Simon Ramo medal, which honors exceptional achievement in systems engineering and systems science. IEEE Medals are the highest distinctions that the IEEE presents. Sha has led the creation of acomprehensive system engineering approach to design and build complex real-time systems, advancing the field from one using hand-crafted, trial-by-error processes into one that is a scientific engineering discipline. The approach, called Generalized Rate Monotonic Scheduling (GRMS) theory, developed with John Lehoczky and Raj Rajkumar, provides predictability, efficiency, and flexibility for scheduling complex concurrent real-time tasks. GRMS has become the best practice of the real-time computing industry, and is regularly taught in real time computing classes. Shas IEEE Fellow citation states, for technical leadership and research contributions which enabled the transformation of real-time computing practice from an ad hoc process to an engineering process based on analytic methods. From 2015-2017, Sha was appointed by Administrator of NASA, Charles Bolden, to the Aeronautics Committee of the NASA Advisory Council. He was selected for this council based largely his contribution to real-time computing and to complexity reduction and control architectures. The Simplex architecture allows the safe use of difficult or unverifiable complex control software. Its principles have been successfully used to improve the stability advanced avionics systems. Sha and his team invented the Physically Asynchronous Logically Synchronous (PALS) architecture. Steven P. Miller of Rockwell Collins Inc. demonstrated that, using PALS architecture, the model checking time of a dual redundant flight control system dropped from over 35 hours to less than 30 seconds. Sha and Millers team received the 2009 David Lubkowski Award for the Advancement of Digital Avionics from American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Examples of Research Impacts He is a widely cited author in real-time and embedded computing community. His work contributions to the development high technology systems include: Global Positioning Satellite : Contributions to the worldwide navigation. The navigation payload software for the next block of Global Positioning System upgrade recently completed testing. This design would have been difficult or impossible prior to the development of rate monotonic theory, L. Doyle, and J. Elzey Successful Use of Rate Monotonic Theory on A Formidable Real-Time System , technical report, p.1, ITT, Aerospace Communication Division, 1993. International Space Station : Through the development of Rate Monotonic Scheduling, we now have a system that will allow [Space Station]Fr eedoms computers to budget their time, to choose between a variety of tasks, and decide not only which one to do first but how mu ch time to spend i n the process , Aaron Cohen, Deputy Administrator of NASA, October 1992 (p. 3), Charting The Future: Challenges and Promises Ahead of Space Exploration. Mars Pathfinder : When was the last time you saw a room of people cheer a group of computer science theorists for their significant practical contribution to advancing human knowledge? It was quite a moment. For the record, the paper was L. Sha, R. Rajkumar, and J. P. Lehoczky. Priority Inheritance Protocols: An Approach to Real-Time Synchronization. In IEEE Transactions on Computers, vol. 39, pp. 1175-1185, Sep. 1990 . reported by Dr. Michael Jones in http:// catless . ncl .ac. uk /Risks/ 19.49.html Over the course of his career, he has also served as a member of the National Academy of Sciences committee on Certifiably Dependable Software, the peer review panel of Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch at NASAs Langley Research Center, and the NSFs Planning Committee on Cyber Physical Systems on high assurance medical devices. Publications Education Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students, UIUC, 1999 and 2000 GE Scholar, the Academy for Excellence in Engineering Education, UIUC, 1999. For young researchers: Elements of Successful Research and How to Write Research Papers Current Projects Real Time Multicore Computing Single Core Equivalence : Each core in a multicore chip can be used and certified as if it were a single core chip, allowing Virtual Single Core : A set of cores of a multicore chip can be used as if it were a large single core chip. The recent research focus on modern high performance CPU-GPU real-time computing architecture. Real-time Virtual Synchrony: A networked avionic system can be programed as if it were a perfectly synchronized system under the Physically asynchronous Logically Synchronous (PALS) protocol.For dual redundant flight control system, the verification time without PALS is over 35 hours. Using PALS, the verification time dropped to less than 30 seconds, winning the David Lubkowski award for the Advancement of Digital Avionics from American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Medical Best Practice Guidance (GPS) Systems In 1999, the challenge of preventable medical errors was first raised in a landmark study by the American Medical Association: To Err is Human . This study reported that at least 44,000 people, and perhaps as many as 98,000 people, die in hospitals each year as a result of medical errors that could have been prevented . In 2013 Journal of Patient Safety reported that more than 400,000 people die every year because of preventable medical errors. The negative economic impact was estimated at a colossal $1 trillion per year in a US Senate hearing in 2014 . Preventable medical errors are not a medical knowledge problem. It is a medical cyber-physical system challenge in the form of medical information and workflow management challenge, where the medical devices, doctors, nurses, and technicians have to work together flawlessly in real-time. Like how GPS revolutionized navigation, Medical Best Practice System will revolutionize clinical practices. Currently, we are working with Carle Foundation Foundation Hospital and with OSF Illinois Childrens Hospital in the research and development of medical best practice systems. The Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation Guidance System has entered Phase II evaluation at Carle ICU. We also completed the initial prototypes of Sepsis Guidance System. Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation Guidance System Review Medical staff with the assistance of the guidance systems will achieve: More rapid and accurate identification of critical changes of patient conditions, More rapid and consistent entry of vital information Fit into current clinical workflow, Stricter adherence to up-to-date standardized medical treatment guidelines and protocols, Improved team effectiveness, and Reduced medical errors from an altered sense of time and memory lapses ( due to high stress ). Carle Foundation Hospital: Karen White, M.D., Vasantha Reddi, Ph.D. Pediatric Sepsis Guidance System Prototype Review Computerized Guidance System will: Assist clinicians with early detection of pediatric sepsis by providing real-time assistance with clinical management of pediatric sepsis Facilitate continued assessment of septic children while providing feedback on next steps in management and Improve adherence to accepted practice standards for management of pediatric sepsis Early vascular access and timeliness of fluid administration Improved rates of antibiotic administration within 60 minutes of presentation Serve as resource to teach less experienced clinicians and clinicians-in-training important tenants of pediatric sepsis management Serve as a tool for simulation-based training and in situ training OSF Childrens Hospital of Illinois & JUMP: Richard Pearl, M.D., Jonathon Gehlbach, M.D. Positions Available Part-time jobs in the lab: software development and/or hardware device interfaces Recent Posts New Initiative: Engineering Next Generation Medical Systems Posted on April 1, 2013 by Admin We have started a new initiative towards safe and effective medical systems.

We approach the subject through an integrated analysis of DNA sequence, gene expression, and epigenetic data. We also strive to understand how sequences involved in gene regulation have evolved. Broadly speaking, our work falls in the areas of regulatory and comparative genomics . Principal Investigator : Saurabh Sinha.

faculty	Hari Sundaram University of Illinois About Me Research Publications Teaching Contact & Meet Me Hari Sundaram Hari Sundaram is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science and in the Advertising Departments at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His research, motivated by the challenge of "persuading millions of people to adopt behaviors (e.g. adopt healthy lifestyles) that would be beneficial to them,'' lies at the intersection of social network analysis and computational advertising. Analyzing the question of behavioral change at massive scale, requires us to develop new theoretical frameworks, design algorithms, build scalable systems and perform field experiments. His research has won awards from the ACM and IEEE societies.

faculty	Hello, Friend. My name is Matus Telgarsky . I am an assistant professor at UIUC . I received my PhD at UCSD in 2013 under Sanjoy Dasgupta . I study mathematical aspects of machine learning. Current interests. Approximation/representation power of deep networks. I proved there exist deep networks which can only be approximated by shallower networks if they have exponentially as many nodes ( arXiv , video , lecture notes one and two ), and continue to work on related questions (e.g., rational functions , and generative networks (with Bolton Bailey) ). Generalization of deep networks. The empirically-observed excess risk correlates with the Lipschitz constant of networks, and yields a generalization bound ( arXiv , poster , video ). Optimization and implicit regularization of deep networks. In grad school I studied AdaBoost, and found that taking the step size to 0 leads to margin maximization ( arXiv ). Ziwei Ji and I have been studying margin maximization for deep networks, first proving it for logistic regression ( arXiv ), and then for deep linear networks ( arXiv ). Other interests. In the past I focused on boosting and clus te ring ; in the future i hope to study reinforcement learning. Teaching. Machine learning theory (CS 598 TEL): fall 2019, fall 2018 , fall 2017, fall 2016. Machine learning (CS 446): spring 2019 , spring 2018. Miscellaneous. I have two glorious PhD students: Bolton Bailey , Ziwei Ji . My research is funded by an NSF CAREER award , and an NVIDIA GPU grant. During summer 2019 I am co-organizing a Simons Institute summer program on deep learning ; I was also at the Simons Institute during Spring 2017 . I co-founded the Midwest ML Symposium (MMLS) and moreover co-chaired the 2017 and 2018 editions, all together with glorious Po-Ling Loh . I have a degree in violin performance from Juilliard , but hardly play any more . I coded a screensaver , a 3-d plotting tool , and a few other things if you know where to look. My desk is always messy . I like scifi books, pencils , ramen , and aphex twin .

Errata are posted as I find them. The image of the Monterey Cypress is there because of the NSF-funded CIPRES project , whose purpose was to develop the methods and computational infrastructure to improve large-scale phylogeny estimation. Why I wrote this book . Research Positions Available: I have openings in my group for graduate students (PhD or MS) to work on developing computational methods for large-scale multiple sequence alignment, phylogeny estimation, metagenomics, and even historical linguistics. Strong programming skills, mathematical intuition, and interest in collaboration are necessary. If you are already a graduate student at UIUC, please contact me directly. If you are interested in applying to UIUC for graduate school and would like to work with me, please read this first and then contact me. Unfortunately, I do not have any funding available for postdoctoral researchers. However, if you have your own source of funds and have published papers directly related to my research, I'll be glad to talk with you about working together. (If you are an undergraduate , please see this page .) Current Funding : Multiple sequence alignment , funded by NSF grant ABI-1458652, beginning August 2015. This project will develop new methods for multiple sequence alignment, building on our SAT, PASTA, and UPP methods. Metagenomics , funded by NSF grant III:AF:1513629. This is a collaborative grant with the University of Maryland, for new methods for metagenomic dataset analysis, building on our TIPP method for taxon identification of reads in a metagenomic sample. Graph-Theoretic Algorithms to Improve Phylogenomic Analyses , funded by NSF grant CCF-1535977. I am the overall PI, and this project is collaborative with Satish Rao (UC Berkeley PI) and Chandra Chekuri (UIUC). We are developing new theoretical computer science and discrete algorithms for improving the estimation of large species and gene trees, and specifically enabling statistical methods to scale to ultra-large datasets. Recent NSF funding has supported work in phylogenomics, described here . This is still an area of very active research in my group. I also recently benefited from support of the John P. Simon Guggenheim Foundation , and earlier support from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation , the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University , the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University , and Microsoft Research, New England .

faculty	Professor Abernathy and colleagues in SEAS, the Economics Department, Harvard Business School, and the Boston University School of Management are concerned with the productivity of the entire manufacturing channel from raw materials to finished products sold at retail. These interests led to the formation at Harvard of a Center for Textile and Apparel Research, which is a part of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation's Industry Centers Program.The competitive dynamics in the textile-apparel-retail industries are being transformed by significant changes in retailing, especially technological innovations that allow retailers to offer consumers a growing variety of products while reducing their own exposure to inventory risk.The Center research has documented the responses of apparel and textile suppliers to these changes, and provides significant analysis and recommendations for the industry. These themes are developed in a major book, A Stitch in Time: Lean Retailing and the Transformation Of Manufacturing  Lessons from the Apparel and Textile Industries, available from Oxford University Press.Among other findings, the book shows how apparel-manufacturing firms using information technology extensively can hold less than half the inventory, and bear substantially less risk while earning twice the profits of companies that do not invest in these practices.Professor Abernathy, his students, and collaborators are involved in developing understanding of how to achieve optimal sourcing of the steps of the production process while minimizing inventory risks. The current focus of the research concerns product proliferation, the logistics of items in production, overall production cycle time, and real options to reduce inventory risk.
faculty	Joanna Aizenberg pursues a broad range of research interests that include biomineralization, biomimetics, self-assembly, crystal engineering, surface chemistry, nanofabrication, biomaterials, biomechanics and biooptics.She received the B.S. degree in Chemistry in 1981, the M.S. degree in Physical Chemistry in 1984 from Moscow State University, and the Ph.D. degree in Structural Biology from the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1996. She then went to Harvard University where she did postdoctoral research with George Whitesides on micro/nanofabrication and near-field optics.In 1998 Aizenberg joined Bell Labs as a member of the Technical Staff where she has made several pioneering contributions including developing new biomimetic approaches for the synthesis of ordered mineral films with highly controlled shapes and orientations, and discovering unique optical systems formed by organisms (microlenses and optical fibers) that outshine technological analogs, and characterized the associated organic molecules. In 2007 Aizenberg joined the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.Professor Aizenberg's research is aimed at understanding some of the basic principles of biomineralization and the economy with which biology solves complex problems in the design of functional inorganic materials. She then uses biological principles as guidance in developing new, bio-inspired synthetic routes and nanofabrication strategies that would lead to advanced materials and devices. Aizenberg is one of the pioneers of this rapidly developing field of biomimetic inorganic materials synthesis."In the course of evolution, Nature has developed strategies that endow biological processes with exquisite selectivity and specificity, and produce superior materials and structures," says Aizenberg. "This is wonderfully exemplified in the realm of inorganic materials formation by organisms, so-called 'biomineralization'. Learning from and mastering Nature's concepts not only satisfies humankind's insatiable curiosity for understanding the world around us, but also promises to drive a paradigm shift in modern materials science and technology."
faculty	Professor Aziz has made significant contributions to a number of fields in applied physics and materials science including the kinetics of rapid solidification, pressure and stress effects on kinetics of diffusion and growth, nonequilibrium surface pattern formation during ion irradiation, and applications of materials synthesized utilizing nonequilibrium kinetics.His current research interests include novel materials and processes for energy technology and greenhouse gas mitigation.Finding the energy to power human civilization without ruining the environment is the greatest challenge facing humanity this century. World energy demand is projected to double by mid-century and triple by the end of the century. The overwhelming majority of this power is provided by the combustion of fossil fuels. Their combustion emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. To mitigate the most catastrophic effects of climate change, carbon-emitting power sources must be ramped down and replaced by carbon-free power sources such as wind, solar, biomass and, arguably, nuclear.The cost of wind and photovoltaic electricity has dropped so far that the greatest technical obstacle to us getting the vast majority of our electricity from these carbon-free and renewable sources is their intermittency. The ability to inexpensively and safely store large amounts of energy for use when the wind isnt blowing and the sun isnt shining could solve this problem.The current research of Professor Aziz is centered on stationary electrical energy storage. He pioneered the introduction of aqueous-soluble energy-storing organic molecules into flow batteries, which store the energy in tanks of fluids outside the battery container itself. This approach is advancing the prospects for fireproof, cost effective energy storage in tanks full of aqueous electrolytes.Professor Aziz is also developing a method of capturing carbon dioxide from a power plant exhaust stream or from the air using the organic molecules that have similar functionality to used in flow batteries.
faculty	David C. Bell is Gordon McKay Professor of the Practice of Electron Microscopy at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and also manages the imaging and analysis facility at Harvard University's Center for Nanoscale Systems. Bell received his doctorate in physics from University of Melbourne, and did his postdoctoral study at MIT. His research focuses on nanocomposite materials' properties and applications for optical and structural uses, theory and applications of aberration-corrected analytical electron microscopy of nano-materials, and charged particle beam lithography using high-energy electrons and ions for fabrication and modification of nanoscale devices. He has authored numerous publications and books and is on editorial boards of several materials and microscopy journals. Bell is a fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society UK.
faculty	Katia Bertoldis research involves the use of continuum mechanics and applied mathematics to model the mechanical behavior of novel materials at the small scale, such as nano-composites and biological composites.The aim of her group is to establish relationships between the internal structure of a material and its mechanical properties. The greater understanding of existing and potential discovery of new materials, especially those with improved and even tunable properties, have direct use in many critical fields, including acoustics, optics, and electronics.Her primary areas of interest include: continuum mechanics analyses of behavior of modern materials; buckling and instabilities; waves propagation; constitutive modeling of polymers; computational mechanics; fracture mechanics; applied mathematics; and the mechanical behavior of biological materials.Prior to her appointment at Harvard, Bertoldi was an Assistant Professor at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. She earned a Ph.D. in Mechanics of Materials and Structures from the University of Trento in Italy; an International Masters in Structural Engineering from Chalmers University of Technology in Goteborg, Sweden; and a Laurea Degree in Civil Engineering from University of Trento.
faculty	Its an exciting time to carry out research in materials. Not only do material scientists design and process new and improved materials but also materials now pace the development of many technologies, ranging from information processing to energy-efficient gas turbines for aircraft and electrical power generation. But what about materials for the future? How can we make sustainable materials when only limited supplies of critical elements exist on our planet?Since coming to Harvard, my group is carrying out long-term research in two new areas: using dielectric elastomers for energy conversion and soft robotics and using microbes to make, and recycle, materials. Dielectric elastomers behave as compliant capacitors: apply an electric field and they change shape. Alternatively, deform them and they will generate an electric voltage, very efficiently. (More details are given in the Research area of our web-site). Several energy materials  materials that are critical to more energy efficient technologies  consist of scarce elements, elements that have extremely low concentrations on earth. For instance, tellurium. It is used in CdTe solar cells and in many of the most efficient thermoelectrics, yet it is amongst the rarest elements on earth. In our group we are exploring the use of microbes to extract tellurium from existing devices and ores so that this rare element can be sustainably used for generations to come. Our research has also opened up the possibility of using microbes to grow films, such as used in solar cells, from earth abundant, non-toxic elements.Professor Clarke has been involved in many different materials research and development programs, contributing to ceramics, metals, composites and semiconductors, as well as introducing new approaches for studying the interrelations between microstructure and properties. He is author or co-author of more than 350 papers, holder of 6 patents, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.Professor Clarke is currently accepting graduate students in the area of dielectric elastomer and devices, as well as microbial processing of materials.
faculty	Professor Cynthia Friend is a Professor of Chemistry and Materials Science at Harvard University. She obtained a B.S. degree in chemistry at the University of California at Davis, and continued her studies to obtain a Ph.D. at the University of California at Berkeley. She then did her postdoctoral work at Stanford University, and shortly after began at Harvard University.The research in the Friend group is motivated by an interest in several technologies, including heterogeneous catalysis, nanostructure growth, environmental chemistry, laser-assisted materials processing, and chemical sensor technology.
faculty	My research is on understanding the physics of novel nanostructured materials to create sensors and actuators. My group works on light detection and absorption of nanomaterials, the Smith-Purcell effect as well as multispectral analysis. We study nanostructured semiconductors, such as silicon, germanium and indium antimony, and metallic nanowires, such as gold, silver and magnetic metals.From these materials we fabricate different photonic and electromechanical sensors for environmental studies, mining explorations, food analysis, and microfluidic/photonic sensors and actuators for precision medicine.
faculty	Robert D. Howe is Abbott and James Lawrence Professor of Engineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Professor Howe founded the BioRobotics Laboratory in 1990, which investigates the roles of sensing and mechanical design in motor control, both in humans and in robots. His research interests focus on robot and human manipulation and the sense of touch. Biomedical applications of this work include the development of robotic and image-guided approaches to minimally invasive surgical procedures. Dr. Howe earned a bachelors degree in physics from Reed College, then worked as a design engineer in the electronics industry in Silicon Valley. He received a doctoral degree in mechanical engineering from Stanford University in 1990, and then joined the faculty at Harvard.
faculty	Hutchinson and his students work on problems in solid mechanics concerned with engineering materials and structures. Buckling and structural stability, elasticity, plasticity, fracture and micromechanics are all relevant in their research. Two examples of on going research activities are efforts to extend plasticity theory to small scales and the development of a mechanics framework for assessing thermal barrier coatings.Strong size effects come into play at the micron scale in the plastic deformation of metals. The effect is tantamount to increased strength at smaller scales: smaller is stronger. The phenomenon derives from the generation of higher densities of dislocations when strain gradients occur at small scales. It has great importance for micron scale metal structures such as thin films and small MEMS devices. Conventional plasticity theory does not contain any size effect, and the effort of Professor Hutchinson and his collaborators is directed at the formulation of a physically correct continuum theory that encompasses a size effect. Efforts are underway to analyze new experimental data, to make contact with dislocation modeling, and to apply the theory to problems of technological significance.Ceramic thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are now widely used in aircraft and power generation turbines to shield engine blades and other metal components from high temperatures. A new generation of engines will exploit these coatings to enable higher operating temperatures. The technological challenge is to enhance the lifetime of the coatings under these more severe operating conditions. The durability of the coatings is limited by their tendency to delaminate and spall. There is a host of mechanics problems and issues waiting to be understood related to the performance of the coatings. Professor Hutchinson, his students and collaborators are involved with a larger community of engineers and material scientists who are actively exploring all aspects of TBCs.
faculty	Boris Kozinsky works at the intersection of fundamental physics of materials properties, efficient computational algorithms, and data-intensive informatics approaches. The overall vision is to leverage the rapidly expanding power of computation and data science to accelerate discovery and design of new practical materials needed for breakthroughs in energy storage and conversion systems. Performance of these systems is controlled by atomic-scale transport and reaction mechanisms and their coupling at different length and time scales that are difficult to probe by experiment alone. Atomistic and electronic structure computations are emerging as a powerful tool for understanding and distilling the design rules governing quantum-level microscopic effects.Boris Kozinsky studied at MIT for his B.S. degrees in Physics, Mathematics, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and received his PhD degree in Physics also from MIT in 2007. He then established and led the atomistic computational materials science team at Bosch Research in Cambridge MA, working closely together with leading academic and industrial groups. Leveraging over a decade of experience in industrial application-driven research, Boris Kozinsky emphasizes technological relevance and rapid screening methods for high performance materials and devices, in close collaboration with experiments. His work on development and application of computational methods led to advances and inventions in a wide range of materials systems, including 1D and 2D materials, piezoelectrics, thermoelectrics, batteries, super-ionic conductors, catalysts, and functional polymers.Current work is focused on:Design and discovery of materials for next-generation batteries, fuel cells and sensors using computations of electronic structure of correlated oxides, electrochemical activity and stability, and ionic conductivity of cathodes and solid electrolytes.Development of accurate and efficient computational methods by combining first-principles quantum calculations with multiscale analytical models of transport, lifetimes and coupling of electronic, thermal and ionic carriers.Machine learning approaches for accelerated materials discovery by identifying structure-property relationships and computable descriptors of complex materials properties, and by enhancing accuracy and efficiency of computational methods.Database-driven cloud infrastructure for intelligent automation of computational workflows, enabling exascale data generation, reusability and analytics.http://bkoz.seas.harvard.edu

faculty	Xin Lis research group focuses on the design of new energy related materials through advanced characterizations and simulations. By combining electrochemistry, (in situ) electron microscopy, (in situ) X-ray diffraction and first principles simulations, we try to understand the relationship between atomistic structure and electrochemical property of materials. The scientific understanding guides the design of new energy related materials with technological importance, especially energy storage materials such as cathodes, anode s and solid electrolytes for lithium or sodium ion batteries with improved energy density, cyclability and safety. The group is also interested in obtaining a general understanding on how microscopic interactions in the atomistic configurational unit can decide the collective behavior in layered metal oxides, such as NaTMO2 and unconventional superconductors.
faculty	Charles M. Lieber was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1959. He attended Franklin and Marshall College for his undergraduate education and graduated with honors in Chemistry. After doctoral studies at Stanford University and postdoctoral research at the California Institute of Technology, he moved to the east coast in 1987 to assume the position of Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Columbia University. Here Lieber embarked upon a new research program addressing the synthesis and properties of low-dimensional materials. He moved to Harvard University in 1991 and now holds a joint appointment in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, as the Mark Hyman Professor of Chemistry, and the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He has served as the Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology since 2015. Lieber is Co-Editor of the journal Nano Letters, and serves on the Editorial and Advisory Boards of many science and technology journals. Lieber has published over 380 papers in peer-reviewed journals and is the principal inventor on more than 50 issued U.S. patents. Lieber has been active in commercializing nanotechnology, and founded the nanotechnology company Nanosys, Inc. in 2001 and the nanosensor company Vista Therapeutics in 2007.At Harvard, Lieber has pioneered the synthesis of a broad range of nanoscale materials, the characterization of the unique physical properties of these materials and the development of methods of hierarchical assembly of nanoscale wires, together with the demonstration of applications of these materials in areas ranging from electronics, computing, photonics, and energy science to biology and medicine.Over the past decade, the development of nanoelectronics-enabled cellular tools of increasing sophistication and power has become a central focus in Liebers laboratory. Examples of this work include integration of arrays of nanowire transistors with neurons at the scale that the brain is wired biologically, mapping functional activity in acute brain slices with high spatiotemporal resolution, and a 3D structure capable of interfacing with complex neural networks. Using macroporous 3D sensor arrays as tissue scaffolds to mimic the structure of natural tissue, he generated synthetic tissues that can be innervated in 3D. Liebers current work also focuses on integrating electronics in a non-invasive manner within the central nervous system. Most recently, he has demonstrated that this polymer-like mesh electronics can be injected by syringe to position devices in a chosen region of the brain. Chronic histology and multiplexed recording studies demonstrate absence of immune response and noninvasive integration of the injectable electronics with neuronal circuitry, resulting in recording stability on time scales of up to a year. The Lieber groups concept of and focus on seamless integration of electronics with the brain to serve as a therapeutic tools capable of treating neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, stroke and traumatic injury is drawing increasing attention from the scientific and medical communities.

faculty	Technologies of the future, including high-performance exascale computing, Internet-of-Things, and integrated quantum information processing are limited by conventional device concepts and their constituent materials. The limits of electronic, optical and thermal performance of these materials are determined by their atomic-scale dynamics. In order to surpass conventional, bulk properties of materials, an accurate description of excited-state phenomena is essential. Quantum-engineered materials could provide multiple functionalities, using atom-by-atom engineering, in an ultra-compact, 3D monolithically integrated architecture enabling highly energy efficient devices. This is simultaneously relevant in consumer electronics and next-generation space-systems and satellites. Professor Narangs research interests lie in exploring and expanding the understanding of excited state and non-equilibrium phenomena to develop novel quantum engineered materials and devices with applications in sensing and photodetection, energy conversion, as well as quantum information processing. Our research group, the Excited-state and Integrated Quantum Materials (ESIM) group, portfolio encompasses the following key directions:Excited-state nanophotonics presents a critical challenge and opportunity as it involves competing degrees of freedom and constraints with coupled electrons, photons, and atomic structures. Properties that emerge from correlations between these atomic, electronic and photonic phenomena determine the intermediate length and time scales that can be exploited in many applications. In order to design functional mesoscale materials, there is a need for advanced understanding and control over the interactions among discrete atomic-nanoscale ingredients in an extended structure. The Narang group is building a research effort that, through a combination of applying existing theory methods as well as developing novel methods that implement non-equilibrium theories, can tackle this challenge.A major challenge and opportunity for energy nanotechnologies is to rationally construct nanoscale devices from the bottom up that can mimic natural light-harvesting assemblies. Photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) feature arrays of strongly-coupled pigments that can direct energy transfer to their reaction center with near-unit quantum efficiency. Yet current technologies do not take advantage of the unique and extremely efficient energy transfer mechanism, which involves out-of-equilibrium, environment-coupled excitonic dynamics. Natural energy transfer in photosynthesis thus points to new physics capable of motivating the next generation of circuits, energy conversion devices and perhaps a path to robust quantum devices. The Narang research group is writing novel tools to describe interactions between light harvesting complexes and the environment in the ultrafast (femtosecond) to fast (nanosecond) regime. We are exploring the fundamental optical physics of cavities strongly coupled to the elaborate topology of molecules.Quantum materials offer unparalleled potential for atomic-scale photonic and optoelectronic devices. The Narang group is studying quantum materials to elucidate the fundamental physics of light-matter interactions in these systems.Open positions: Students in my research group will gain expertise in developing and using first principles theory, calculation and quantum simulation methods.

faculty	Professor Rice addresses the mechanics and physics of earth and environmental processes. That involves the solid and fluid mechanics of stressing, deformation, fracture and flow to address problems in seismology and tectonophysics, glaciology, and surficial geologic processes, as well as in geomechanical and hydrological aspects of civil and environmental engineering.In his work on earthquakes, he has addressed rupture nucleation in relation to laboratory fault friction properties, dynamic slip propagation, and stressing and seismicity in the lithosphere, and has developed models of earthquake sequences and interactions along faults. That work has addressed continental strike-slip zones, particularly the San Andreas fault, and subduction zones worldwide. Also, he has developed the theory of poroelastic and other effects in fluid-infiltrated earth materials, with applications in geophysics and geotechnology, and has contributed to the theory of deformation localization into shear zones, the constitutive representation and stability analysis of frictional slip, and the modeling of landslides. His work on engineering mechanics and materials physics has addressed the theory of stress fields near crack tips and crack propagation, especially in elastic-plastic metals, brittle cracking along interfaces between dissimilar materials, conservation integral metodology in fracture theory, the structure of inelastic constitutive relations for ductile crystals and polycrystals, microscopic mechanisms of cleavage and dislocation generation at crack tips, ductile rupture by plastic hole growth, creep failures by diffusive cavitation, and the thermodynamics of interfacial embrittlement by solute segregation. As part of his work, he has contributed to techniques of finite-element computational mechanics for inelastic and large-strain problems, and more recently to spectral computational methods for crack and fault dynamics.Current work in his group is on the science of earthquakes and on hydrologic processes involving fluid interactions with deformation and failure of earth materials as they arise in seismology as well as in landslides, glacial motions, fluid injections, and tsunamis. Topics include slip-rupture dynamics through branched and offset fault systems, including effects of damaged fault-border zones, physics of fault friction, thermally driven pore fluid pressurization and fault weakening in rapid slip, seismicity and transient aseismic deformations in subduction zones, tsunami generation and propagation, landslides and the transition to debris flows, meltwater penetration through glaciers, sliding processes at their beds and iceberg calving, and computational mechanics methodology for problems in some of those domains.

faculty	Devices in modern technologies (e.g., microelectronics, MEMS, photonics, and biosensors) are integrated structures of diverse materials, complex architectures, and small feature sizes. Their function, fabrication, and reliability pose urgent mechanics problems. As the experimental and computational capabilities change drastically, the division of labor is shifting: What to understand? What to measure? What to compute? Suo and his students aim to create scientific models of small-scale processes that have significant engineering consequences. The following examples illustrate the promise of future growth in mechanics.Mechanics of nanofabrication. Mass-producing nanostructures is a great challenge of our time. Several fabrication processes have recently shown astonishing capabilities. For example, nanoimprint has brought time-honored printing technology to such an exquisite size scale. Mechanics has long played significant roles in manufacturing, such as metal forming, ceramic sintering, and polymer molding. More recently, success stories have accumulated in applying mechanics to nanoscale fabrication. Examples include the stability of a strained thin epitexial film against dislocation injection, and strain-induced self-assembly of quantum dots. In collaboration with electrical engineers at Princeton University, Suo and his students have recently studied the mechanics of fabricating zero-defect, strain-free SiGe films on oxides. The research has led to great improvement of the fabrication process.Mechanics of self-assembly. As photolithography reaches its limit of resolution, many alternative patterning technologies are under intense investigation. Among them are various processes of self-assembly. What are the forces that assemble these structures? What structures can be produced? Suo and his students are studying molecules adsorbed on a solid surface, forming a pattern of disks or stripes, of stable sizes on the order 1-100 nm. The simulation of the group has suggested experimental means to form a perfect periodic pattern or, more remarkably, desired aperiodic patterns. The group is also exploring means for programmable transport of functional molecules on a chip.Mechanics of durability. Nearly all materials in the on-chip interconnect structure have been changed in recent years. The feature size has already gone below 100 nm. Temperature cycling has long been used as a test to qualify devices. After being cycled between two temperatures, say -55C to 125C for 1000 times, a device is tested for its function, and then sectioned and examined in microscopes for failure modes (e.g., distortion and cracking). If a failure mode is found, one makes a new device by modifying either processing parameters, or geometry, or materials. The new device is temperature cycled again, followed by the microscopy examination. These make-and-break iterations are extremely time consuming. Scientific understanding of this test is of great value. In collaboration with researchers at Intel Corporation, Suo group has identified a new failure mechanism, called ratcheting-induced stable cracking (RISC). The mechanism shows how, in an integrated structure, the cycling temperature gradually breaks a brittle solid.
faculty	Professor Vlassak studies the thermo-mechanical behavior of a broad range of engineering materials. He has developed experimental methods to characterize phase transitions and solid-state reactions in thin films, plastic deformation of coatings, elastic anisotropy in indentation, and fracture of thin films. Current experimental research projects focus on the mechanical behavior of hydrogels and the use of hydrogels as ionic conductors in 3D printed devices. Recently, Professor Vlassak pioneered the use of combinatorial nanocalorimetry for the development and analysis of complex materials systems, including metallic glasses, ultra-high temperature ceramics, and high-temperature shape memory alloys. Combinatorial nanocalorimetry provides a convenient way of mapping the energetics and kinetics of phase transitions and solid-state reactions as a function of composition, making it an ideal experimental tool for the Materials Genome Project. The technique also lends itself for the characterization of thermal fatigue and stability of functional materials, as well as for the optimization of heat treatments.Past research projects focused on the mechanical degradation of electrodes in lithium ion batteries as a result of lithium insertion, on the effects of microstructural length scales on the mechanical behavior of thin metal films, and on the effect of chemical species on the adhesion and delamination of multilayered structures containing low-k dielectrics.Theoretical work includes modeling of chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) based on contact mechanics, channel cracking in films on substrates of finite thickness, and various analyses of the effects of substrate properties and film porosity on nanoindentation of thin films.

faculty	Professor Angluin is interested in machine learning and computational learning theory. Algorithmic modeling and analysis of learning tasks gives insight into the phenomena of learning, and suggests avenues for the creation of tools to help people learn, and for the design of smarter software and artificial agents that flexibly adapt their behavior. Professor Angluins thesis was among the first work to apply complexity theory to the field of inductive inference. Her work on learning from positive data reversed a previous dismissal of that topic, and established a flourishing line of research. Her work on learning with queries established the models and the foundational results for learning with membership queries. Recently, her work has focused on the areas of coping with errors in the answers to queries, map-learning by mobile robots, and fundamental questions in modeling the interaction of a teacher and a learner. Professor Angluin helped found the Computational Learning Theory conference, and has served on program committees for COLT and on the COLT Steering committee.

The lack of language constructs in configuration files, such as types and grammars, has directed the focus of a configuration file verification towards building post-failure error diagnosis tools. In addition, the existing tools are generally language specific, requiring the user to define at least a grammar for the language models and explicit rules to check. In this paper, we propose a framework which analyzes datasets of correct configuration files and derives rules for building a language model from the given dataset. The resulting language model can be used to verify new configuration files and detect errors in them. Our proposed framework is highly modular, does not rely on the system source code, and can be applied to any new configuration file type with minimal user input. Our tool, named ConfigC, relies on an abstract representation of language rules to allow for this modularity. ConfigC supports learning of various rules, such as orderings, value relations, type errors, or user defined rules by using a probabilistic type inference strategy and defining a small interface for the rule type. Close A Type-Directed Approach to Program Repair Alex Reinking and Ruzica Piskac In Proceedings of Computer Aided Verification (CAV), 2015 Paper (pdf) Developing enterprise software often requires composing several libraries together with a large body of in-house code. Large APIs introduce a steep learning curve for new developers as a result of their complex object-oriented underpinnings. While the written code in general reflects a programmers intent, due to evolutions in an API, code can often become ill-typed, yet still syntactically-correct. Such code fragments will no longer compile, and will need to be updated. We describe an algorithm that automatically repairs such errors, and discuss its application to common problems in software engineering.

Based on provided examples, our tool automatically generates scripts for non-trivial file manipulations. Although the current focus of StriSynth are file manipulations, it implements a more general string transformation framework. This framework builds on and further extends the functionality of Flash Fill -- a Microsoft Excel extension for string transformations. Close InSynth: A System for Code Completion using Types and Weights Tihomir Gvero, Viktor Kuncak, Ivan Kuraj, and Ruzica Piskac In Proceedings of Software Engineering & Management, 2015 Paper (pdf) Developing modern software typically involves composing functionality from existing libraries. This task is difficult because libraries may expose many methods to the developer. To help developers in such scenarios, we present a technique that synthesizes and suggests valid expressions of a given type at a given program point. As the basis of our technique we use type inhabitation for lambda calculus terms in long normal form. We introduce a succinct representation for type judgements that merges types into equivalence classes to reduce the search space, then reconstructs any desired number of solutions on demand. Furthermore, we introduce a method to rank solutions based on weights derived from a corpus of code. We implemented the algorithm and deployed it as a plugin for the Eclipse IDE for Scala. We show that the techniques we incorporated greatly increase the effectiveness of the approach. Our evaluation benchmarks are code examples from programming practice; we make them available for future comparisons. The results presented here were published as a research paper at the ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation, (PLDI 13), Seattle, WA, USA, June 16-19, 2013. This extended abstact also contains some excerpts from the original paper. Close From Decision Procedures to Synthesis Procedures Ruzica Piskac In Proceedings of Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing, 2015 Paper (pdf) Software synthesis is a technique for automatically generating code from a given specification. The goal of software synthesis is to make software development easier while increasing both the productivity of the programmer and the correctness of the produced code. In this paper we present an approach to synthesis that relies on the use of automated reasoning and decision procedures. First we describe how to generalize decision procedures into predictable and complete synthesis procedures. Here completeness means that the procedure is guaranteed to find code that satisfies the given specification. We illustrate the process of turning a decision procedure into a synthesis procedure using linear integer arithmetic as an example. However, writing a complete specification can be a tedious task, sometimes even harder than writing the code itself. To overcome this problem, ideally the user could provide a few input-output examples, and then the code should be automatically derived. We outline how to broaden usability and applications of current software synthesis techniques. We conclude with an outlook on possible future research directions and applications of synthesis procedures.

Close InSynth: A System for Code Completion using Types and Weights Tihomir Gvero, Viktor Kuncak, Ivan Kuraj, and Ruzica Piskac In Proceedings of Software Engineering & Management, 2015 Paper (pdf) Developing modern software typically involves composing functionality from existing libraries. This task is difficult because libraries may expose many methods to the developer. To help developers in such scenarios, we present a technique that synthesizes and suggests valid expressions of a given type at a given program point. As the basis of our technique we use type inhabitation for lambda calculus terms in long normal form. We introduce a succinct representation for type judgements that merges types into equivalence classes to reduce the search space, then reconstructs any desired number of solutions on demand. Furthermore, we introduce a method to rank solutions based on weights derived from a corpus of code. We implemented the algorithm and deployed it as a plugin for the Eclipse IDE for Scala. We show that the techniques we incorporated greatly increase the effectiveness of the approach. Our evaluation benchmarks are code examples from programming practice; we make them available for future comparisons. The results presented here were published as a research paper at the ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation, (PLDI 13), Seattle, WA, USA, June 16-19, 2013. This extended abstact also contains some excerpts from the original paper. Close From Decision Procedures to Synthesis Procedures Ruzica Piskac In Proceedings of Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing, 2015 Paper (pdf) Software synthesis is a technique for automatically generating code from a given specification. The goal of software synthesis is to make software development easier while increasing both the productivity of the programmer and the correctness of the produced code. In this paper we present an approach to synthesis that relies on the use of automated reasoning and decision procedures. First we describe how to generalize decision procedures into predictable and complete synthesis procedures. Here completeness means that the procedure is guaranteed to find code that satisfies the given specification. We illustrate the process of turning a decision procedure into a synthesis procedure using linear integer arithmetic as an example. However, writing a complete specification can be a tedious task, sometimes even harder than writing the code itself. To overcome this problem, ideally the user could provide a few input-output examples, and then the code should be automatically derived. We outline how to broaden usability and applications of current software synthesis techniques. We conclude with an outlook on possible future research directions and applications of synthesis procedures. Close Journal Paper Thesis Workshop Papers Technical Reports Projects ConfigC Misconfiguration errors account for the majority of downtime in real-world deployed systems. ConfigC is a machine learning based system to automatically learn specifications for configuration files and check for correctness. It uses an association rule learning approach to build sets of predicates any correct configuration files must satisfy. G2 G2 is a symbolic execution framework for Haskell that utilizes evaluation and translation of semi-compiled Haskell source. The project is intended for automatic program exploration and input-output example generation, with additional goals to tackle difficult problems such as constraint solving for higher-order functions. Winston Winston is a type-directed expression synthesis tool that can also generate repairs of ill-typed expressions from their sound subexpressions. It uses a novel search space pruning technique based on graph distance to run interactively. GRASShopper GRASShopper is an experimental verification tool for programs that manipulate dynamically allocated data structures. GRASShopper programs can be annotated with specifications expressed in a decidable specification logic to check functional correctness properties. The logic supports mixing of separation logic and first-order logic assertions, yielding expressive yet concise specifications.

faculty	NISHEETH K. VISHNOI NISHEETH K. VISHNOI RESEARCH My research spans several areas of theoretical computer science: from approximability of NP-hard problems, to combinatorial, convex and non-convex optimization, to tackling algorithmic questions involving dynamical systems, stochastic processes and polynomials. I am also broadly interested in understanding and addressing some of the key questions that arise in nature and society from the viewpoint of theoretical computer science. Here, my current focus is on natural algorithms, emergence of intelligence, and questions at the interface of AI, Ethics, and Society.

My general research interests include computer networks, wireless networks, sensor networks, mobile computing, and network security. I lead the Laboratory of Networked Systems (LANS) at Yale University. Previously, my primary research interest is on designing robust, efficient and fair computer networks, where autonomous, heterogeneous traffic controllers optimize their objectives measured by both traditional performance metrics and non-traditional metrics such as economical metrics and survivability. Research Highlights: Content Distribution We propose, design and implement multiple protocols and mechanisms to improve the efficiency and robustness of Internet content distribution. The P4P framework (SIGCOMM 2008) for ISP and content distribution app integration; see IETF ALTO Working Group for standardization effort. The Data Locker (SIGCOMM ICN 2012) framework for in-network storage. The ShadowStream framework (SIGCOMM 2012) for realsitic debugging. The CMO framework (SIGCOMM 2012) for cost and performance optimization. Robust, Efficient Internet Traffic Engineering (TE) We have designed and completely implemented the TORTE system, which is the first integrated traffic engineering, routing system that can handle topology failures, traffic variations, and service requirements (e.g., priority) with provable guarantees. A set of overview slides for intradomain TE (SIGCOMM 2010) Multihoming: one-hop interdomain TE (SIGCOMM 2004) Interdomain TE as social choice Ingress interdomain TE Egress interdomain TE Incentive-compatibility/Economics of Network Design We design and analyze protocols considering incentive-compatibility. P2P Live streaming Wireless mesh BGP as social choice Wireless Throughput Optimization We improve wireless throughputs by avoiding collisions to creating "beneficial" collisions such as superposition and matrix net. superposition coding and ipack remap and matrixnet Argos Network Localization We provide the first complete foundation of network localization. A set of overview slides Research Questions and Objectives: The central question driving much of my research is the following: What are the guiding principles and practical techniques for achieving robust and efficient computer networks? Our research methodology is to integrate rigorous analysis with careful system design, practical implementation, and whenever possible large-scale field tests with real users. The objective of rigorous analysis is to reveal and derive the most fundamental guiding principles and to provide provable guarantees. As an example, instead of an ad-hoc system design, our P4P framework derives the interfaces between networks and network applications through rigorous primal-dual optimization decomposition. The objective of system implementation and large-scale field tests is to ground the principles in the real world. Some of our systems have undergone extremely large-scale field tests (e.g., P4P has been test-deployed with millions of real users at five of the largest Internet service providers in the world); some of our tools have been used by multiple other groups around the world (e.g., TORTE and Network Localization).

We effortlessly demonstrate enormous flexibility and generality, which hides its staggering complexity: Nearly half of the primate brain processes visual information. Our group is attempting to put the requirements of vision systems together with insights from neurophysiology and the rigor of mathematics to develop an abstract theory of computational vision. Based on differential geometry, it leads to methods of curve detection and shading and texture analysis.

faculty	M. P. Anantram's Website Menu Skip to content Home About Classes Code and Patents Contact Group Publications Research Electrical, Electromechanical, and Optoelectronic Response of Nanodevices We are primarily a Theory & Modeling group who work on a variety of problems in nano devices and materials. The focus of our work centers around developing an understanding of the device physics of both semiconductor and bio nanstructres. We use a variety of tools to model these structures. To find the atomic coordinates we use a variety of semiclassical, Monte Carlo and quantum molecular dynamics method. To study the electronic properties, we use both density functional theory and tight binding methods. To study the electrical transport properties of nanostructures,we develop both algorithms and code based on Greens function methods. We work on both fundamental and applied problems. Our current directions of focus are: DNA Nanostructures: Figure: DNA consists of two single strands in a double helix. The distance between the bases is ~ 3.4 . Biomolecules (DNA, peptides and RNA) offer a platform for electronic devices. Electrical methods for sequencing and disease detection, with the biomolecule as channel for charge transport have recently been demonstrated. Deoxyribo Nucleic Acids (DNA), the building block of life, is a nanoscale material that can be engineered precisely. Its immense potential arises from the ability to form arbitrary sequences with high accuracy and create complex 1D, 2D and 3D structures. From the viewpoint of material science and engineering, the electronic properties of DNA are important for (i) engineering sequences with device properties and (ii) all electrical methods for disease detection. The main challenges to move the field forward are the inter-related needs to develop a robust design methodology that can yield sequences with specific electrical properties and gain the ability to rapidly predict the conductance of a given sequence. This is a huge challenge which needs multiple iterations between computational and experimental efforts because (a) the environment cannot be precisely controlled, (b) of the sheer large number of possible sequences even for a strand that is only ten bases long and (c) there are currently not enough controlled experiments with a variety of base sequences to provide inputs or feedback to design. Along with our experimental collaborators, we are pursuing amulti-pronged approach combining theory & modeling , the efficient use of data, chemical synthesis, and transport experiments to effectively design electrical properties of DNA . At the mesoscopic level, DNA consists of four distinct building blocks, Guanine (G), Adenine (A), Thymine (T), and Cytosine (C). The most common form of DNA is quasi one-dimensional, and consists of two complementary single strands in a double helix. Each strand consists of the four building blocks linked together by a sugar-phosphate backbone. The strands are held together by hydrogen bonding between bases on complementary strands. When isolated, the four building blocks have distinct energy levels, highest occupied (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied (LUMO) molecular orbitals, electron affinities, and ionization potentials, all of which are important factors in determining the electronic properties. Synthetic chemistry allows these building blocks to be further expanded by using artificial bases, where the mentioned energies can be designed. The rich and interesting electronic properties of DNA emerge from the interaction between bases, both along and between strands, and with the backbone and environment. The different energy levels and ionization potentials of bases provide a vehicle to engineer the bandstructure along a DNA strand, which gives rise to the possibility to create wells , barriers and superlattices that form the materials basis for electronic devices such as resonant tunneling diodes, heterostructure junctions, as well as more exotic species such as quantum-interference (QI)-based transistor platforms. Moreover, the recent emergence of 2D and 3D DNA-based nanostructures, which are engineered via techniques like DNA origami provides a platform that is capable of integrating unique DNA electronic structures into a device platform or even into higher dimensional device integration (3D). Achieving this goal has been difficult with conventional semiconductor technology, and any integration has been difficult at the molecular-scale. As such, DNA-based devices provide a unique opportunity to overcome several of the issues with both conventional electronics (bottom-up manufacturing and quantum transport) and nanoscale electronics (reproducibility and integration). As such, these devices may form the basis for developing widely deployable devices that exploit quantum transport effects, or may form a basis for a more conventional vehicle for electronics beyond the limits of lithography. One can think of quantum wells and barriers constructed from DNA as having transmission-resonances akin to double barrier resonant tunneling diodes and superlattices built from conventional semiconductor heterostructures. Additionally, these devices may be biocompatible, thus opening opportunities for utilizing the electronic properties of DNA for sensing, diagnostics, or health-care applications. Given this broad-range of potential applications, the primary goal of this proposal is to iteratively develop these building-blocks, through the intimate interaction between theory, experiment, and synthesis, so that large-scale systems and DNA-based applications can begin being actively designed, built, and utilized. An additional very exciting field is the link between diseases and DNA sequences, mutations, and chemical modifications. The transport through DNA is inherently quantum mechanical in nature, and as such mutations in the bases cause a change in energy levels, which translates sequence information into transport properties. This fact has given rise to ideas centering on whether these mutations can be electrically detected. Of great interest are recent experiments that show the potential to detect diseases and sequence DNA by measuring electrical conductance of a single DNA molecule. These studies demonstrate the potential for an all-electrical method for disease detection, a technology that has promise to be portable and inexpensive. Even more important is that it can be used in situations where only a small number of mutated DNA strands are available; situations where conventional amplification methods involving polymerase chain reaction are not suitable. Therefore, the development of a predictive capability for DNA transport properties based on the building blocks will enable the exploration of new paradigms for sensing applications and genetic disease detection. To achieve these goals we are pursuing a a three pronged iterative approach involving (i) modeling and theory involving reduced order models (ROM), (ii) a data driven approach to modeling that connects full order models (FOM) to ROM, and (iii) continuous interplay between theory, transport experiments, and chemical synthesis to verify design predictions and provide feedback for model and performance improvement. 2. Resistive and Phase Change Memory Devices: Figure: Resistive Memory Device: (left) Shows filament growth and breakage, which leads to a low and high resistance state. (right) A model with three and seven Copper atom filaments that we model using DFT and Greens function approaches. Conductive filaments play a role in a number of electronic applications varying from dielectric breakdown, phase change memory and resistive memories. In the case of memory devices, they are a boon, which makes switching between high and low resistance levels possible. The high and low resistance levels in turn are used to represent the 0 and 1 logic states. The conductive filaments in memory devices can be anywhere from a few to tens of nanometers in length. The non equilibrium phenomena of formation and stability of conductive filaments is an open problem that is rich in basic science and of interest to applications. In the area of electronics, the importance of conductive filaments arises from the need for large amounts of non volatile memory (defined to be memory that retains data even when powered down) in both mobile applications and data centers. Applications require nonvolatile memory to have short time scales for reading and writing of the memory state. Flash memory is the current leading nonvolatile memory technology. It is scaled and at the 25 nm technology node, the data retention time is more than ten years. However, continued scaling results in the degradation of retention time and endurance; therefore, the promise of significant areal density improvement beyond todays flash devices is limited. In flash devices, electron charge is the state variable for memory storage, and the number of electrons dramatically decreases with scaling. The presence or absence of electrons in a conducting island buried in an oxide determines the memory state. Recent studies show that when the technology node reaches 16 nm, the memory state will be represented by only ~16 electrons stored in the oxide. In this case, tunneling of a few of these electrons will lead to loss of data. As a result, scaled Flash memory devices can easily fail due to space radiation and thermal fluctuations. To overcome the problems with flash memory scaling and performance, there is interest in technologies that do not use electron charge as a state variable. As opposed to charge based memory (where electrons and holes store information), it is possible to store information in filamentary structures, which represent either the presence or absence of atoms. Atoms are heavy and as a result, the memory state can be retained for a long time. In memory devices, the filamentary structures are formed in dielectric materials, where the presence or absence of a filament bridging electrodes can greatly alter the resistance. Changing the state variable from electron to atom location represents a transformational shift. Conductive filaments are a wide spread physical phenomenon without sufficient understanding and affecting many important technologies that include computer memory, reliability of thin film devices, and power electronics. We are developing a multi-physics approach to understandfilament formation caused by an electric field. The goal is to develop a physics based understanding of filament formation and kinetics. Theoretical and computational models to address: filament formation, high and low resistance values, and switching time between the two resistance values are at the core of our work. The approach involves solving equations underlying both atom movement and electron flow using both Monte Carlo and Greens function based approaches. Temperature plays a crucial role and the heat equation is an important component. 3. Theory and Algorithms: Quantum mechanical effects play an important role in determining the characteristics of nanoelectronic devices. These devices can be classified into two different categories (i) devices where operation is classical but quantum corrections are necessary to model them accurately and (ii) devices where quantum mechanics is central to device operation. Classical transistors which can be quite accurately modeled by drift-diffusion and hydrodynamic equations with some quantum corrections that account for the finite width of the inversion layer and tunneling through the oxide, is an example in the first category. Examples that belong to the second category include many emerging device technologies: (a) tunnel transistors (which can have an inverse sub threshold slope of smaller than classical 60 mV per decade of current), (b) superlattice based quantum cascade devices, (c) spintronic devices, (d) device concepts based on topological insulators and (e) quantum interference devices. In addition, quantum mechanical methods are also required to study the properties of devices based on new nanomaterials such as nanotubes, graphene and nanowires. In these structures, there is significant variation in the electronic properties (band structure, effective mass and density of states) depending on the surface passivation, diameter, and crystalline orientation / chirality. The lack of a set of transferable material properties for these variations makes it necessary to develop atomistic models where the location of atoms can be accounted for accurately. The modeling of devices at the nanoscale is fundamentally quantum mechanical, with robust methods being a necessity for devices in category (ii) and those based on new nanomaterials. New methods need to be developed to make a transformative change by improving simulation speed by at least one order of magnitude. At the simplest level, when the applied voltages and the temperatures are extremely low (typically sub 4K), a nanodevice behaves phase coherently and an approach based on solving for the scattering states and using the Landuaer-Buttiker approach is justified in many cases. To use the Landauer-Buttiker approach, one needs to ensure that the device dimension is significantly smaller than the phase coherence length of the electron wave. However, in almost all situations of interest, devices operate at close to room temperature and away from equilibrium. Momentum and energy relaxation, and the breaking of quantum mechanical phase are important due to excitations such as phonons at finite biases even at low temperatures. The quantum mechanical modeling of devices by including decoherence and scattering has made some progress using a variety of interrelated many-body approaches: non equilibrium Greens function, Liouville equation, density matrix, Kubo-based theory, Pauli master equation and Wigner function. It should also be mentioned that the Monte-Carlo approach has been specifically successful in probing the device physics of a wide class of nanodevices with complicated scattering mechanisms; the only drawback being that it cannot handle quantum coherence. In modeling the electrical properties of devices, the Greens function approach has been rather successful in modeling devices using simplified Hamiltonians in the ballistic (phase-coherent limit) and in some cases with scattering. More recently, this approach has also been use to model silicided contacts in an abinitio manner. We are performing research with our Applied Math collaborator Prof. Ulrich Hetmaniuk to make progress towards the development of mathematical algorithms that can be used in simulation tools to probe device physics and predict the current-voltage characteristics of a broad class of nanodevices.

faculty	University of Washington College of Engineering A Community of Innovators Home People Research Papers EE Home Wind Integration Research Lab (WIRL) Our Research: Renewable Energy is an increasingly important topic on both the national and international stage. Wind energy is a fast growing renewable source and is second only to hydro in terms of renewable energy capacity. There are many technical challenges associated with high levels of wind penetration in a power system, and, as wind energy grows, the need for solutions to these challenges is more pressing. Our group seeks to address the challenge of wind variability and unpredictability on the time scale of hours to days ahead. Our goal is to quantify how wind variability and unpredictability effect different types of conventional generation by running unit commitment simulations.

Defects have historically played an essential role in classical electronic/optical devices. Now new nanoscale devices are being developed based on the quantum properties of defects. We are occupied with the following questions: What are the fundamental properties of a known defect state? Alternatively, by measuring the properties of an unknown state, can we identify it? How can the quantum properties of a defect be engineered and controlled? What new technologies can quantum properties of defects enable? What new capabilities can be realized through solid-state device integration of defects? Fundamental Properties of defects in semiconductor Integrated Photonics Sensing Undergraduate Research There are often open graduate and undergraduate research positions in the group. Interested students should contact Kai-Mei directly. Unfortunately, the group does not fund international undergraduate students seeking summer research experiences.

faculty	Home People Research Videos Publications Undergrad Research Library Renewable Energy Analysis Lab About the REAL Lab Our research focuses on how to build a smart grid that will maximize the amount of energy produced from renewable energy sources at a reasonable cost while maintaining the reliability of the electricity supply at the level to which we have grown accustomed. From Sweden to South Africa and from China to California, governments are encouraging the development of renewable sources of electrical energy. Many of these governments are taking measures to reduce the use of fossil fuels for transportation and heating and are thus likely to increase the proportion of energy that is consumed in electrical form. Accommodating these changes in the generation and consumption of electricity will require a fundamental rethinking in the design and operation of the power grid. A consensus is emerging that many of these challenges could and should be met primarily through the development of a "smart grid" rather than simply building more generating plants and more transmission lines. Recently, we have also focused our research on the resilience of the grid to natural disasters. In particular, we are investigating the following questions: How should repair crews be optimally dispatched in the aftermath of a disaster to minimize the harm done to a community by the absence of electricity? How should a grid be hardened or restructured to minimize the effects of a natural disaster? In this context, researchers from the ReaLab have participated in a project aimed at installing emergency solar + battery nanogrids in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, with more details in the coverage .

faculty	NOISE:Nano Optoelectronic Integrated System Engineering Dream big, think different, work smart!! Home Research Publications Team News Outreach Welcome to the NOISE lab in University of Washington, Seattle. Any technological advancement relies on the synergy of fundamental physics and intelligent engineering. For example, the unprecedented success of information technology in the last century, is fuelled by several physics-Nobel-prize winning discoveries, including, transistors, integrated circuits, lasers and fiber-optics. In Integrated Quantum Optoelectronics lab, we study light-matter interaction, which lies at this intersection between physics and electrical engineering. The fundamental question in optoelectronics is: how to change amplitude, phase and frequency of light, with lower energy, faster speed, smaller size and reduced cost. The solution of this problem is given by efficient engineering of the light-matter interaction. By confining light to a small volume for a long time, scientists have demonstrated light-matter interaction at the most fundamental level enabling single-photon, single atom or single quantum dot (the smallest man-made atom like object) devices. Although unprecedented performances have been demonstrated with these stand-alone devices, unfortunately, no scalable system can be built with them. In our research, we focus on the scalability issue of these low energy optoelectronic devices. More specifically, our research aims to answer: How to make a scalable nanophotonic system (by exploring new materials and novel nanophotonic devices)? Two major challenges for realizing such systems are: weak optical nonlinearity and inherent disorder present in the nano-photonic devices. Hence, we work on cavity enhanced nonlinear optics with 2D materials, as well as, reconfigurable optics design to circumvent the effects of the disorder. Our ultimate goal is to realize single photon nonlinearity using cavity coupled 2D materials, and developing a chip-scale adaptive optics platform. What new applications emerge with development of the scalable optoelectronic systems? A scalable low energy optolectronic system is known to be beneficial for digital optical computing and communication. However, there may be other regimes of optical computing, where the nanophotonic system will be more suitable, like neuromorphic optical computing. Apart from that, these systems can be useful for new class of optical imager, sensors; 3D display technology. With efficient engineering we want to push the energy required in these optoelectronic devices to few photons level, where quantum effects start appearing, and hence these devices can potentially be useful for quantum information science and quantum simulation.

faculty	Home Clinical Trials Research People Publication Links Fun - Navigation - Home Clinical Trials Research People Publication Links Fun Technology to treat paralysis Motor paralysis from stroke or spinal cord injury can be severe and long-lasting, despite damage to a relatively small area of the nervous system. Our goal is to develop neuroprosthetic devices capable of bypassing these damaged areas and restoring volitional control of movement to paralyzed limbs. Our Research Clinical Trials Now Recruiting! Spinal lesion stained for GFAP (red) and microglia (green) Electrode tip imaged with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Neurons recorded from the brain and sorted with PCA Previous Next Restore Transcutaneous electrical stimulation is a non-invasive strategy to modulate spinal circuitry. Utilization of a unique waveform permits high-current electrical stimulation to reach spinal networks without causing discomfort. We are testing the immediate and lasting effects of this potentially break-through treatment for restoring upper extremity function in tetraplegics. Read More Rehabilitate We are investigating the optimal method for delivering non-invasive on skin spinal stimulation to improve standing and walking ability in people with spinal cord injury. We are also exploring the combined approach of intensive exercise and robotic technology with the electrical stimulation. Read More Reanimate We have demonstrated that spinal stimulation evoked arm movements after spinal cord injury. We are currently working on brain signal controlled spinal stimulation to reanimate arm movement after cervical spinal cord injury. In collaboration with Josh Smith, we are testing a completely implantable device capable of decoding brain signal and spinal stimulation for arm function. Read More Repair We are investigating whether intraspinal stimulation is capable of guiding spared pathways to functional targets after spinal cord injury. In collaboration with Phil Horner, we are also exploring the combined approach of stem cell therapies and electrical stimulation. Read More About Us We develop neuroprosthetic technology for the treatment of paralysis and other movement disorders. Our current projects include developing techniques to bypass damaged areas of the nervous system & restore control of movement to paralyzed limbs, promoting recovery and perhaps regeneration of damaged neural tissue, and testing methods for physical therapy and rehabilitation of movement disorders.

The Z-pinch has a simple, linear configuration with no applied magnetic fields. The self-field generated by the axial current confines and compresses the plasma. The concept was investigated extensively for fusion energy applications; however, the configuration is unstable to gross sausage and kink modes. The Flow Z-Pinch Experiments include the original ZaP Flow Z-Pinch, ZaP-HD (High Energy Density), and FuZE (Fusion Z-Pinch Experiment). The research project investigates the concept of using sheared axial flows to provide complete stability without adversely affecting the advantageous properties of the Z-pinch (no applied fields, high temperatures, high densities, unity average beta, and only perpendicular heat conduction). The experiment produces a Z-pinch plasma that is 100 cm long with a 1 cm radius. The plasma exhibits stability for an extended quiescent period. The experiment addresses the basic plasma science issue of the connection between sheared flows and plasma stability. In addition, the concept has applications for fusion energy and advanced space propulsion. The laboratory is located in the basement of the AERB (Rm. 036). The experiment is funded by the Department of Energy (DOE), Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) . The ZaP project is a certified green laboratory, and it has been awarded the 2016 UW Greenest Lab Award by the University of Washington Sustainability .

faculty	Data Compression Laboratory UW Electrical Engineering Welcome to the Data Compression Laboratory at the University of Washington's department of Electrical Engineering . We conduct research in the areas of image and video compression and image processing. The lab is run by Professor Eve Riskin and Professor Richard Ladner of Computer Science and Engineering . The laboratory is supported by the National Science Foundation, Microsoft Research, and Intel Corporation. Research Information Current projects includes research into image compression and classification including our MobileASL project, near-lossless hyperspectral image compression, constant quality rate control in video coding and low bit-rate structured video coding. Past projects in our lab include research into vector quantization (VQ), application of VQ for edge detection and image browsing, VQ design for noisy channels, wavelets, image compression, halftoning, color palette management, unequal loss protection, layered video, and group testing algorithms for image compression. See our other pages for more information about the lab's graduate students, our publications, and courses. Current Students Jessica Tran Joy Kim Sheri Yin Rafael Rodriguez Jaehong Chon Rahul Vanam Publications Our recent publications are available via http. Code We have C code available for full search VQ and tree search VQ from our html directory . These programs output codebook vectors that are close to the input data vectors in a mean square sense, but do not produce the intermediary indices. The file VQcode.tar.Z contains both sets of programs. We also have C code available for joint optimal wavelet packet best basis selection/bit allocation. In addition, Marko Slyz ( mslyz@erim.org ) has provided code to use with the TSVQ programs to produce codebook indices, or to decompress the indices to produce a reproduction of the data.

faculty	Fundamentals of Networking Laboratory Menu Home Publications Research Members Resources Overview Ongoing research at FUNLAB, The University of Washington is focused on fundamental issues underlying the design and analysis of next generation digital networking infrastructure. Current research embraces a wide variety of issues pertinent to both wireless and wired/fiber networks, that includes and integrates the design of physical, data-link layer and the transport layers. Next generation digital wireless networks must accommodate growing numbers of mobile users requiring high data rates (multimedia services) and greater mobility support in a physical environment that is both power/bandwidth limited. Such a formidable challenge requires innovations at all levels in the network, and research at FUNLAB addresses design problems that engage multiple layers, from the physical (transceiver design aspects) to the network transport (routing).

faculty	Home Research Chip Gallery Members Publications News Contact The group currently has multiple post-doc positions available Position Details Here Mission My group's research focus will cover a broad range of topics related to analog, mixed-signal, RF and mm-wave circuits. The emphasis of our work will focus on novel architectures and circuits which overcome the challenges presented by future low-cost, silicon technologies, such as ultra-low voltage, low-intrinsic device gain, and poor matching characteristic, to name a few. Some of my past work has been on integrated circuits for wireless communication systems requiring aggressive performance. A major emphasis of our future research will explore architectures and circuits for highly integrated, concurrently operating, heterogeneous-wireless systems which overcome the evolving challenges associated with co-existence. Other areas of research which I have an interest are mm-wave circuits for 60GHz and imaging applications, low-voltage highly-efficient transmitter systems, ultra-low power RF for cellular based sensor networks, high-speed I/O for chip-to-chip and core-to-memory applications and finally, integrated circuits for bio-medical applications.

faculty	Home Current Research Members Publications Test Facilities Contact Student Info Links As a research lab, we seek to establish novel test techniques regarding mixed-signal circuits and systems. As the mixed-signal ICs get system-on-a-chip complexity, the problem of mixed-mode test evolves. The adaptation of BIST (Built-In Self-Test) techniques and any other DFT (Design For Testability) schemes in this area remains a serious challenge for circuit and test engineers. By leading in this effort both in industry and academia, we aim to develop practical and cost-effective methods in the field of designing and testing of mixed-signal integrated circuits.

I have a dual appointment in both the CSE and EE departments; I am recruiting heavily for both graduate students and postdocs for my team at UW. Interested PhD/MS students should apply to either or both departments and drop me a note (2 chances, 1 great advisor!) Bio I have been a professor in the Paul Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering and Dept. of Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle since September 2017. I was a Visiting Research Scientist at Google , working on datacenter accelerators, and before that I was a tenured professor at the University of California San Diego Computer Science and Engineering Department from 2005 to 2016. I received a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT , and my research centers around computer architecture but spans the stack from VLSI to compilers. I was lead architect of the 16-core MIT Raw tiled multicore processor , one of the earliest multicore processors, which was commercialized into the Tilera TILE64 architecture. Recently, in 2017, Intel Skylake SP has adopted our scalable mesh of cores architecture that we proposed. I co-authored the earliest published research on dark silicon , including a paper that derives the utilization wall that causes dark silicon , and a prototype massively specialized processor called GreenDroid . I also wrote a paper that establishes the definitive taxonomy, the Four Horsemen , for the semiconductor industry's approaches to dealing with the problem, and a follow-on paper on the Landscape of the Dark Silicon Design Regime . My research on dark silicon fed into the ITRS 2008 report that led Mike Mueller of ARM to coin the term "dark silicon". More recently, I wrote the first academic paper on Bitcoin mining chips . In 2016, my team published the first paper on ASIC Clouds . We make the case that datacenters full of ASICs are in our near future, and show a prototypical ASIC Cloud architecture, how they should be designed, and how they save TCO. We proposed neural network ASIC Clouds before Google announced their TPU, and also proposed the use of video transcoding clouds for YouTube. If you read only one architecture paper this year, you should read the IEEE Micro 2017 Top Picks Issue ASIC Cloud Paper . In 2017, we published the first architecture paper on NRE , non-recurring engineering expense. We show how minimizing NRE can be more important for ASIC Cloud feasibility than optimizing accelerator speedup or energy efficiency. We present the first ever architect's model for NRE, using current industry parameters ( paper ) ( youtube talk ), and opening up a new area of research. With the rise of specialization and the end of Moore's law, driving down the cost of design will surely be an important driver of future research. Also in 2017, we taped out the 511-core RISC-V compatible Celerity chip, in TSMC 16nm technology. I occasionally help companies and other legal professionals evaluate their patent portfolios, and provide advice to companies leveraging the Tilera TILE64 architecture, or that are developing cryptocurrency hardware. I have broad expertise in hardware and software, and on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency . My research is funded primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF), including the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace Program , and DARPA/MARCO's C-FAR , part of STARnet. Between the gaps at school, I worked on Apple's NuKernel microkernel, and co-wrote the first version of Connectix Virtual PC, an x86-to-PowerPC dynamic translation engine, which was acquired by Microsoft. I also contributed to the ChipWrights Visual Signal Processor in its earliest stages. I received the NSF CAREER Award in 2009 and tenure in 2012. My research sponsors: UW Center for Dark Silicon I direct the UW Center for Dark Silicon and the Bespoke Silicon Group. My colleagues and I were among the first to demonstrate the existence of a utilization wall which says that with the progression of Moore's Law, the percentage of a chip that we can actively use within a chip's power budget is dropping exponentially ! The remaining silicon that must be left unpowered is now referred to as Dark Silicon . Our research on Conservation Cores and GreenDroid proposes new architectures that exploit dark silicon. Our paper on the The Four Horsemen ( slides ) overviews the landscape of architectural approaches to addressing dark silicon. In addition to researching architectures for dark silicon, I look more broadly at sources of under-utilization in current day chips, spanning from a) power limitations because of poor CMOS scaling, b) overly large software engineering costs for parallelizing programs for multicore chips, and c) lack of parallel application domains. My research attacks each of these problems by 1) reinventing processor design to make use of dark silicon, 2) utilizing existing cores better through better parallel software engineering tools and 3) finding new parallel application classes to put cores to work: The GreenDroid Mobile Applications Processor, which employs Conservation Cores to fight dark silicon. Our ASPLOS 2010 paper is one of the earliest peer-reviewed architecture papers to have a cogent description of the utilization wall that causes the Dark Silicon problem, and to propose specialization as an architectural solution. Our Hotchips 2010 work GreenDroid: A Mobile Application Processor for a Future of Dark Silicon flushes out this proposal, and is quite possibly the first published academic use of the term Dark Silicon . This was followed up with this March 2011 IEEE Micro paper . (Here is the Hotchips talk on youtube .) Our work, Is Dark Silicon Useful? Harnessing the Four Horsemen of the Coming Dark Silicon Apocalypse , which appeared in DAC and DaSi 2012 , and is followed by a paper in IEEE Micro 2013, is the first paper to overview the landscape of architectural approaches that try to address the dark silicon problem. We describe the four horsemen -- four approaches to dealing with dark silicon, each with deep-seated challenges but also unique capabilities. See the slides for a very entertaining presentation on the shrinking, dim, specialized, and deux ex machina horsemen. Kremlin , a tool that, given a serial program, tells you which regions to parallelize. To create Kremlin, we developed a novel dynamic analysis, hierarchical critical path analysis , to detect parallelism across nested regions of the program, which connects to a parallelism planner which evaluates many potential parallelization to figure out the best way for the user to parallelize the target program. the San Diego Vision Benchmark Suite , which distills the emerging computer vision application class into a collection of nine benchmarks written in a research-friendly style. This work was co-advised by Prof. Serge Belongie , a member of UC San Diego's top-notch vision faculty. More recently, we have developed CortexSuite , which extends SD-VBS with a large suite of machine learning and other applications that traditionally the brain has been better at that computers.

July 2009 Successfully passed the FAA written test and landed an airplane four times at Long Beach Airport (LGB)! June 2009 National Science Foundation CAREER Award: Energy-Efficient Parallel Architectures for Computer Vision . FAQ Who came up with the term "dark silicon"? The first use of the term in print was a quote by Bob Metcalfe in March 1997 in the IEEE Internet Computing magazine. However he was referring to all of the sand in the world that has not yet been turned into chips! The first mention of the term I've seen in its current context was by ARM CTO Mike Muller at ARM techcon in October 2009. I've heard other folks say that the term was used by others in ARM and/or HiPeaC community earlier than then. Although ARM techcon happened after we had submitted our ASPLOS paper in Aug 2009 that discussed the utilization wall, we thought it was genius and decided to use the term in the title of our immediately following Hotchips 2010 paper. How did our group arrive at the utilization wall which causes Dark Silicon, and specialization as an approach to attacking it? In 2003, I spent a few months reading 300+ ISSCC and IEDM papers with the goal of comparing the (very different) IBM CMOS7SF and Intel P858 fabrication processes as part of a Raw-versus-Pentium-3 section of the Raw ISCA paper I was working on. I was also trying to understand VLSI scaling better so that we could make better proofs about Raw's optimality. In 2004, I was trying to come up with some ideas for research as a faculty member. I decided to analyze the scalability of multicore chips like Raw across process generations. Using skills picked up from the study I did for the Raw ISCA paper, I arrived at the conclusion that there was an exponentially worsening power issue with multicore scaling and that the problem was the utilization wall and the dark silicon it creates . The analysis is the same as appears in our subsequent grant proposals and papers. On the interview trail for faculty positions in 2005, I tried to sell the idea of the utilization wall one-on-one with interviewing faculty and further proposed that the "ugly chip" (a massively heterogeneous design) was a logical response. Most everybody didn't believe me or thought it was a terrible idea (James Hoe of CMU, to his credit, thought it was interesting.). In 2006, as brand new faculty members, Steve Swanson and I cowrote a peer-reviewed 2006 NSF proposal that outlined the utilization wall and created a plan for exploring massively heterogeneous solutions. (Indeed, Steve named our analysis the utilization wall, and already himself had a CAREER award on software aspects of heterogeneity.) (Here is a April 2007 snapshot of our public website talking about the utilization wall.) After one round of rejection by peer review, the proposal was funded. The utilization wall appears in the abstract of our NSF Award in July 2008. After many paper resubmissions, countless co-advising trials and tribulations, we finally got the utilization wall in peer-reviewed academic literature in this March 2010 ASPLOS paper . MIT Raw Processor As one of the lead students in the MIT Raw project , I led the design and implementation of the Raw microprocessor, which targeted the leading VLSI technology of the time. I also contributed heavily to almost all of the software systems that we built to support the microprocessor. Raw was one of the earliest fabricated multicore processors, with 16 cores on a single die, back in 2002. The purpose of Raw was to demonstrate architectural solutions to scalability problems in modern day microprocessors. The Raw architecture exposes the transistor resources of VLSI chips through the tile abstraction, the pin resources through the I/O port abstraction, and the wiring resources through on-chip networks . Raw was commercialized into the Tilera TILE64 architecture . Because the Raw architecture exposed the on-chip resources more effectively than existing sequential architectures (for instance the P6 micro-architecture, the basis of the Pentium-M), Raw was able to outperform Intel desktop processors, implemented with better process technology, across a variety of applications. One of the key ideas that came out of the Raw research was the formulation of the Scalar Operand Network (SON), a unique class of sub-nanosecond network responsible for routing operands between functional units and memories in a distributed microprocessor. My team implemented the 16-tile Raw microprocessor, shown to the upper-left, in IBM's SA-27E 180 nm 6-layer Cu ASIC process. The 18.2 mm x 18.2 mm chip was, at least at the time, the largest design that the IBM ASIC division had targeted for SA-27E. Each tile contains computing power equivalent to a single-issue pipelined processor. A supercomputer prototype, based on 4-chip boards, that scaled to 64 Raw chips (1024-issue) was constructed.

faculty	Welcome Sensors Systems Education Outreach Sensors Our sensors research focuses primarily on chemical and biological sensing, with an emphasis on creative smart sensor designs to enable applications of sensors that continue to be inaccessible via conventional sensing paradigms. Our team has worked with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using the evanescent field of guided light to detect refractive index and binding of chemicals of interest to functionalized SPR probes; chemiresistive sensor arrays using composite polymers to detect vapor-phase chemicals, LED-based systems for low-cost fluorescence detection, ChemFETs for pH and related electrochemical sensing, and automated colorimetrics to compensate for interferents in liquid media. Read MORE... here . Systems Our work in smart sensors has led to a natural extension of our effort to system design. For example, our work in controlling the spectral output of LEDs for fluorescence analysis has led to an interest in organic LED systems whose instability and degradation require custom feedback circuits to stabilize illumination levels. Monitoring and management of degradation in organic devices is also applicable to organic photovoltaic (PV) systems, especially portable ones, where individual PV cells become shaded, soiled, or degraded to the point that significant power can be stolen from the overall energy harvesting system. Management of arrays, whether they be chemical sensors, photovoltaic cells, LEDs, or other device, requires careful attention to the local signal processing and configuration to ensure that the overall system can capitalize on the contributions of individual cells within the system. Read MORE... here . Education Research should complement education and vice versa. Research in education allows us to ensure that the bridge between these two aspects of academic life converge more than diverge. Our engineering education research ranges from making advances in basic research to developing tools for engineering educators. Our top priority in all the research we do is to support the engineering community from college through retirement in creating learning and work environments that attract, retain, and support a wide variety of engineers who bring an equally broad range of talents and ways of thinking to the classroom and to the workplace. We use a wide variety of research methods including surveys, focus groups, interviews, observations, and evaluation of student work to help us attain our research goals. Read MORE... here .

Caas Associate Professor of Computer Science Wake Forest University (336) 758-5355 canas@wfu.edu I was born in Costa Rica, the happiest country in the world, yes the the Pura Vida country! After graduating from high school, I went to Mxico to pursue my Computer Engineering degree which I completed in 1973. After a year of thinking I decided to go back to school and finished my MS degree in Information and Computer Science at Georgia Tech in 1976. Upon my return to Costa Rica I worked at the recently created Instituto Tecnolgico de Costa Rica (ITCR). During my stay at ITCR, as founder and Director of the Computer Center (wow this sounds old...) I also contributed with the establishment of the Computer Science Department (now recognized as one of the best in the country). In 1980 I received a Fulbright Scholarship and headed to the University of Texas-Austin, where I finished my PhD work in 1983. I then spend 3 years as a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Kansas. In 1987 I accepted a faculty position at WFU. I have been here since, many many wonderful years!

The operating system is a very complex software system. In this course we will examine the most important functions that make up an operating system. In particular we will discuss the following functions: -process management -concurrency -scheduling -memory management -file system An operating system presents common interfaces for programmers to perform various tasks such as I/O, memory management, concurrent process and threads. We will explore this interfaces and will write programs to illustrate all of this services. Even though no particular operating system will be studied in detail, the UNIX operating system will be used as an example. UNIX was chosen because of its widespread use and it is a simple system to understand. The computer language C will be used, since most UNIX systems are written in this language so they provide a very clean interface to the services provided. More information.. Overview of Computer Science CSC-101 This course will introduce the student to the filed of computer science and what computer scientists do. Programming is just a tool as calculus is a tool for mathematicians. The course will cover topics from how a computer actually work to how use a computer to solve complicated problems. A Web page will be kept up to date and is your first source of information. All slides /assignments/home-works/labs/ etc. will be posted. Most materials will be posted electronically rather than distributed as handouts. More information.. Mobile Programming CSC-391 Students will select a project based on requests that been received from other departments. Each project will have a counterpart from the department requesting the development. Students will design the user interface and requirements in conjunction with the end-user counterpart. They will learn how to develop mobile Apps, based on IOS with Objective C and Swift. This will be done by them in a self study approach with the supervision of the instructor. Students will be assigned weekly readings and programming exercises and in parallel they will have weekly meetings with the end-user to analyze progress and the overall structure of the system. More information.. Introduction to UNIX and C CSC-191 This course will provide an introduction to Unix, its tools using command line and to the C programming language. Students should master the basic Unix tools like grep, find and vi, file system commands and shell programming. They will also become familiar with the C programming language with emphasis on pointers, character/string manipulation and command line arguments. More information.. Undergraduate Research Floating Point Multiplication in Pipeline Architectures Benjamin Walsh Undergraduate Honors Thesis Abstract There is an ever-increasing demand for speed when it comes to modern technology. There are many different approaches to achieving an increase in processing speed. One such strategy is called pipelining, in which a computational task is broken down into subcomponents called stages. Buffering is added between the stages so that once a set of inputs has made it to the second stage, a new set of inputs can be started at the first stage, and so on. This allows for multiple computations to be occurring at the same time in the pipeline, which leads to an increase in throughput. This study focuses on a floating point multiplier, a common application of a pipelined design because it offers tremendous speedups. Both a non-pipelined and a pipelined floating point multiplier were implemented in a program called LogicWorks, which is a tool for interactive circuit design. Running simulations of each of the circuits allowed for a side by side comparison of their speeds. Although the pipelined multiplier required more hardware, it offered significantly better throughput Scheduling Algorithms Interactive Simulator Gavin Borg Undergraduate Honors Thesis Abstract To fully understand the conceptual principles behind operating systems it must be possible to 'see' what is happening inside the system as the execution of a task progresses. A graphic representation of information flow would give a clear picture of what is happening inside an operating system at every moment. This research presents a graphic representation of information flow inside an operating system, in particular the short term scheduler. This is done via an App developed for the iOS system. Real Time Semaphore Execution Tracing Justin DeBenedetto Undergraduate Honors Thesis Abstract The EZIPC library simplifies inter-process communication between concurrent processes for users. This allows users new to concurrency and inter-process communication to effectively learn about semaphores and shared memory without having to simultaneously manage the more complex system calls that these normally require. Semaphore tracing has been previously implemented to allow users to view the actions of their semaphores post-mortem. The goal of this project is to allow users to view, in real time, the actions of semaphores during program execution in a readable way. This involves implementing a way to suspend execution when a semaphore is used in order to allow to user to walk through the program step-by-step. This also involves designing an interface that provides the user with the most information possible at each step and presents this information in a readable way. The University Calendar in a WFU framework Lesley Gustafson Undergraduate Honors Thesis Abstract The University Calendar app is an attempt to make the Wake Forest University Calendar more accessible to students, faculty, staff, and the Winston-Salem community. The content is accessed through an API, and then displayed in an iPhone friendly user interface. The home screen is designed so that users can filter through the calendar content based on their specific needs. Category and date filters can be applied for this purpose. Detail views for each event make time, date, location, and description more quickly accessible. WFU Parking Matthew A. Simari Undergraduate Honors Thesis Abstract The Wake Forest Parking mobile application provides all members of the Wake Forest community will real-time data on where they can park on-campus and how available the parking may be. By employing extensive GPS, mapping, and iOS functionality, the Wake Forest parking application provides a much needed service in a very sophisticated way. Cardio View: Equipment use in Miller Center Rachel Black Undergraduate Honors Thesis Abstract As the population of students at our campus grows with each year the facilities that students use on a daily basis are starting to feel overcrowded. Our campus gym, the Miller Center, is no exception especially during certain hours of the day. In an attempt to lighten the frustration of students, the Cardio View iPhone application was developed. This application models a currently popular website, Laundry View, which gives students the ability to view the status of the laundry machines in each of the dorms. In a similar manner our application allows students to view the status of the cardiovascular machines at the gym, as a way to gauge how crowded the gym is prior to their arrival. We use external sensors on the equipment that broadcast data to a server. On the server we utilize a support vector machine which, based off of training data, decides if each machine is in use, as well as calculating how long it has been at that particular status. The application then downloads this data in real time, along with location based data, to create a map of the Miller Center with the machines colored based on their usage. In addition these machines are click able to show the user how many minutes they have been in use. We have many future plans to expand the project including but not limited to a web and android interface, and utilizing push notification to allow users to be notified when a machine becomes available. Foreign Exchange Markets: An Algorithmic Approach to Intra-Day Scalping Strategies Stewart Warther Undergraduate Honors Thesis Abstract The global Foreign Exchange market accounts for approximately $4 trillion in transactions daily. In recent years, this market has become dominated by high-frequency and algorithmic traders who profit from intra-day transactions and short-term price fluctuations. This paper will examine topics and strategies employed by modern currency traders, focusing particularly on the use of Statistical Arbitrage. These strategies will are implemented and tested in real time to examine the efficacy of commonly employed technical indicators and betting techniques. A Trace Driven Technique for Debugging Concurrent Processes Dan Applegate Undergraduate Honors Thesis Abstract The EZIPC library is used to simplify the implementation of interprocess communication in C and C++ programs written for System V Linux based machines. By reducing the number of complicated system calls and structures used needed for communication among concurrent processes, the learning curve is reduced, and students may better learn about the theories and practical applications of semaphores and shared memory blocks. However, EZIPC does not provide support for message queues, and there is no easy way to monitor the semaphores being used. This paper outlines a proposed solution, and discusses issues with implementing tracing functionality to EZIPC. Server Implementation in Microkernel-Based Operating Systems Andrew Davis Undergraduate Honors Thesis Abstract Nearly all modern operating systems used for personal computing are now based on monolithic kernels. By changing to a microkernel-based architecture, though, systems could dramatically improve reliability and security in the system at the cost of a small performance penalty. In this paper, the structure of microkernel based operating systems is described, through the kernel, driver, server, and application layers. Finally, the implementation of a microkernel server is shown, using MINIX 3 to implement a server that provides a semaphore service to user applications. Mobile Apps Mobile devices are a part of our daily life. They are everywhere, from simple music players to sophisticated GPS devices. We are an interdisciplinary group composed of undergraduate students who are interested in the developing software for this emerging technology. Our members come from a variety of academic disciplines: Computer Science, Business, Mathematics, Economics and Physics just to name a few. There is only one requirement: willingness to learn about mobile applications, and have fun developing the apps, from Freshman to Seniors all are welcome. Old Gold & Black Mara Rodriguez, ... The students newspaper iOS 5 Choice Serial Reaction Time ... The 5 choice serial reaction time task is an operant technique that measures attention capabilities in laboratory animals. The purpose of this project is to build an app for the iPad that mimics this task in order to measure attention capabilities in people. The task works by presenting brief targets that the person must correctly identify by touching the screen, and the task becomes increasingly more or less difficult depending on individual performance. Gathered data should be made available for further analysis. iOS Laundry View Michael Moore Many companies are turning to the mobile market in order to increase their appeal and ease of access; the key factor in the formation of WFU LaundryView.

Cerniglia Students develop an iPhone app to track the shuttles' locations using a GPS program. The shuttle location is updated every five seconds so riders know when to head out to meet the bus. The GPS devices send their location to a centralized server from where the information is picked up by the iPhone/iTouch App which displays the current location of the bus. iOS Shuttle Riders Michael Crouse This iPad App is used in the shuttled busses to keep track of riders. Drivers record at each bus stop, how many passengers boarded the bus and how many passengers left the bus. This information os then sent to a server, where it is stored in a database which is later available via a web interface to obtain statistics about riders and bus stops. iOS ardio View: Equipment use in Miller Center Rachel Black As the population of students at our campus grows with each year the facilities that students use on a daily basis are starting to feel overcrowded.

faculty	Welcome Courses Publications & Patents Contact Welcome Hopefully these pages will provide some insight to my computer science teaching and research at Wake Forest University. If you have any questions or interest, just drop by my office (Manchester 239). Current Research My research interests are primarily in security and computer networks. Current research projects include the following. Nature-Inspired Design Designs found in nature can serve as a source of inspiration, providing robust and efficient methods that are well suited to address various complex problems. We have several projects that seek to address difficult computer science problems using bio-inspired approaches such as: network security using digital ants, genetic based computer management, and application discovery using motifs. Our current nature-inspired project uses evolution-based techniques to manage different types of complex systems (for example, computer servers or surveillance cameras). The approach improves system resilience by automatically adapting to environment changes (such as, user demand, software additions and/or updates, as well as attacks). Other nature-inspired projects include Computer Evolution as a Moving Target Defense Ant-Based Cyber Defense Network Security Group This research group is investigating several security issues related to the next generation of high-speed and QoS-enabled networks. The group is directed by me and all those interested are invited to join. Failure prediction and management Prediction methods for critical computer events (hardware/software failures and security). Given the increased reliance on parallel/distributed systems, managing failure will become critical.

faculty	David John Search this site David John bchc ga "how to" PDC Modules (with Stan Thomas) Sitemap David John Professor of Computer Science Faculty Director of WakerSpace 251 Manchester Hall ( Building 20A ) Wake Forest University djjATwfu.edu I am a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at Wake Forest University . The Computer Science department offers undergraduate and graduate degrees through Wake Forest College and Wake Forest Graduate School of Arts and Sciences , respectively. I am also affiliated with the Wake Forest Center forMolecularSignaling and Communication (CMSC). For 2018-2020 I have been appointed the Faculty Director of WakerSpace, the Wake Forest University maker space. WakerSpace is a new opportunity available to the Wake Forest community. Much more information about WakerSpace will be forthcoming soon. Fall 2018courses : CSC222 (Data Structures and Algorithms II), CSC721 (Algorithms) Detailed information about these courses are available to the registered students within the Wake Forest Learning Management System . The focus of my current research interests is the development of high quality gene interaction models from multiple replicates of gene transcription data. The modeling process is based on specialized genetic algorithms in conjunction with Bayesian based likelihood functions. Directed acyclic graphs play a most important role in this modeling approach. We are actively working with the addition of time series adjustment to the core directed acyclic graph analysis paradigms. This is interdisciplinary research with colleagues in CMSC. Ancillary research involves Wake Forest undergraduate research assistants: SQ, KH and ZG. SQ is studying algorithms that enumerate simple cycles in a directed graph. Her goal is to improve the restoration of a directed graph, produced by combination of directed acyclic graphs, to a directed acyclic graph. KH is developing a scheme, based on hashing, of efficientlysearching for directed acyclic graphs. ZG is studying python based parallel and distributed computation. His goal is to incorporate a shared hash table, storing directed acyclic graphs, into a parallelexecution of the gene interaction modeling program. With Professors Muday, Turkett, and Norris, we are collaborating on an NSF funded research project: Ethylene Transcriptional Networks. Outside of work, I enjoy being out of doors. From yard work, to trail work with PATH on the Appalachian Trail, to backpacking, I keep quite active. As well, my wife and I enjoy eating, visiting with family and friends, listening to music, reading and just hanging out.

He is currently the President of the IEEE Biometrics Council (20152017). [20] Technical Accomplishments Govindarajus research has focused on the application of machine learning and pattern recognition techniques to domains such as Document Analysis and Recognition and Biometrics and, in particular, the development of real-time engineered systems. He has developed principled modeling approaches for pattern classification that have resulted in the development of robust, scalable systems in a variety of application domains, from document processing to biometrics. He has designed several algorithms for cursive handwriting recognition suitable for real time applications that demonstrated the benefits of innovative modeling of application constraints. His language-motivated hierarchical modeling has been extended to computer vision applications such as scene understanding and classifying activities and gestures in unconstrained videos. He has also made contributions to the theoretical foundations of a general fusion architecture and taxonomy of trained combining functions (classifiers) and their input parameters which provides a principled guideline for choosing a particular fusion technique. Engineered Systems Govindaraju's work in handwriting recognition [22] [23] was at the core of the first handwritten address interpretation system used by the United States Postal Service (USPS). The learning-based system that he developed as project technical lead along with his colleagues at the University at Buffalo helps save the USPS hundreds of millions of dollars by automatically processing, and barcoding for precise delivery, over 25 billion letters a year. [24] This work was highlighted in the Computing Community Consortium's symposium on Computing Research that Changed the World in 2009 as one of the most successful applications of Machine Learning for developing a real-time engineered system. [25] [26] The Government Executive publication reported in 1999 that "USPS issued a contract to researchers at the State University of New York at Buffalo to develop the handwriting recognition technology. It was first launched in 1997 right before the Christmas holiday season. One year later, an estimated 400 million pieces of mail were automatically routed during the Christmas season alone using the handwriting recognition technology. The new technology has saved the Postal Service at least $90 million in its first year in the field." [27] USPS Engineering Vice President William J. Dowling singled out Lockheed Martin and its suppliers, the State University of New York at Buffalo, and Parascript, LLP, for their work in improving RCR performance. [28] Edward Kuebert, manager of image and telecommunications technology at USPS also credited improvements in reader technology to the State University of New York at Buffalo, Lockheed Martin Federal Systems and the Parascript Group of Boulder, Colo. [29] Pattern Recognition Techniques Govindaraju developed a suite of efficient and field-tested image processing routines for handling the contour representation in handwritten word images. [30] [31] Departing from the myriad of heuristic approaches, he introduced a statistical approach to binarization and noise removal by modeling the degraded document as a Markov Random Field (MRF) where the prior is learnt from a training set of high quality images, and the probabilistic density is learnt on-the-fly. [32] Govindaraju modeled active recognition along the lines of the A* algorithm. [33] This method provides a multi-resolution framework for adapting to factors such as the quality of the input pattern, its intrinsic similarities with patterns of other classes, and the processing time available. Finer resolution is accorded to only certain zones of the input pattern which are deemed information bearing given the classes that were being discriminated. Govindaraju has contributed to the combination (fusion) of pattern classifiers and proved that the optimal combination algorithm for identification systems is difficult to express analytically because of the difficulty presented by the dependencies between matching scores assigned to different classes by the same classifier. [34] He developed the first taxonomy of the complexity of classification combination methodoogies and a guideline for choosing a particular type of fusion technique. [35] Document Recognition and Retrieval Handwriting Recognition Models Govindaraju developed the first handwritten word recognition module suitable for real time applications [36] using an innovative dynamic matching algorithm to assign automatically segmented pieces of words to lexical entities. Prior methods modeled either discrete features or continuous features but not both. The early models were extended to a new stochastic framework which modeled sequences of features that combined discrete symbols and continuous attributes. [37] Govindaraju has incorporated the theories of reading and perception developed in psychology literature in analyzing handwritten words [38] and demonstrated its uses in postal address reading. [39] He has also contributed to improvement in word recognition accuracy of unconstrained handwritten documents by applying OCR correction techniques [40] in a bootstrapping framework where innovative topic categorization techniques are used to generate smaller topic-specific lexicons. [41] His work on multi-lingual OCR spans recognition of Arabic [42] and Devanagari script. [43] His book on the OCR of Indic Scripts [44] is the first comprehensive book on this subject. Govindaraju developed a performance model that statistically "discovers" the relation between a word recognizer and the lexicon. It uses model parameters that capture a recognizer's ability of distinguishing characters and its sensitivity to lexicon size. Such a model is useful in comparing word recognizers by predicting their performance based on the lexicon presented. He described the notion of lexicon density as a metric to measure the expected accuracy of handwritten word recognizers. [45] [46] Document Analysis Systems Govindaraju authored a widely-cited system-level paper describing the architecture of an end-to-end system for reading unconstrained handwritten page images. [47] Prior research in handwriting recognition treated phrases as a concatenation of the constituent words. He presented a methodology that took advantage of the spacing between the words by modeling the word breaks as a feature of the individual writing style. [48] [49] He developed a bank check reading system that could leverage the recognition of the legal amounts (written in long hand) in the decision making process along with the existing and more accurate recognition of courtesy amounts (numeric strings). [50] He enabled recognition of medical forms by modeling the relationships between handwriting and medical topics. This technique showed that a few automatically recognized characters can be used to construct a linguistic model capable of representing a medical topic category. [51] Innovative Applications Govindaraju developed the first simulation of human-like handwriting for designing CAPTCHAs to exploit the differential in handwriting reading proficiency between humans and machines. [52] The MIT Tech Review (Jan. 2009) highlighted the ingenuity of his Spambot-Fighting Strategy [53] which is grounded in cognitive science principles. He has developed methods that stochastically model imperfect word segmentation inherent in handwriting [54] and techniques for transcript mapping [55] useful for indexing handwritten documents. Biometrics Fingerprint Templates and Matching Govindaraju has explored enhancement and binarization techniques for fingerprint images: Fourier analysis, [56] direction median filters, [57] Harris points, [58] fingerprint quality measures. [59] He proposed a minutia extraction algorithm utilizing the contours of minutia ridges [60] and matching based on features extracted from minutia k-plets and formulated the matching algorithm as a minimum cost flow problem [61] and coupled breadth-first search algorithm. [62] The fingerprint templates stored in biometric databases typically contain the original sensor data, or features, from which the intruder can potentially reconstruct fake biometric samples. Govindaraju invented a unique fingerprint hashing method [63] [64] where only hashes are transmitted and stored in the database, and it is not possible to restore original biometric data from them. He proposed a novel indexing method based on minutia k-plet paths [65] whose search time remains constant even when increasing number of enrolled persons. Face and Facial Expression Analysis Govindaraju proposed one of the earliest model-based face recognition methods [66] [67] and developed a face matching system based on semantic descriptors. [68] He proposed a hybrid facial feature localization method based on graphical models and image sampling [69] and verified the individuality of facial expressions, demonstrating that either displacements of facial features [70] or the frequencies of particular expressions [71] could be used as biometric modalities. He innovated methods for automated detection of deceit in facial expressions using changes in facial geometry, texture [72] and changes in the eye movements. [73] Smart Environments Govindaraju formulated a probabilistic framework for person identification and tracking in smart environments consisting of a set of connected rooms [74] wherein multiple biometric modalities are coupled with the probabilistic track model in this framework. He investigated the concepts of computer security and online user behavior [75] [76] and introduced methods for confirming the identity of online users. [77] [78] Writer Identification Govindaraju has proposed that, although handwriting is unique to writers, writer style represents a shared component of individual handwriting. [79] He explicitly models this conceptualization via a three-level hierarchical Bayesian framework (LDA) for the purposes of writer identification and verification. [80] [81] In this text-independent model, each writer's handwriting is modeled as a distribution over a limited set of writing styles that are shared amongst writers. He has shown that, analogous to speech, accents in writing are treated as distinctive quirks unique to a group of people belonging to a common family of scripts which have roots in cultural and genetic factors.

Promoted as Full Professor, 2017 University at Buffalo, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Senior Researcher of the Year Award, 2016. Best paper award from IEEE Big Data 2015, for our paper titled "Panopticon: A lock broker architecture for scalable transactions in the datacenter". Two NSF research grants received in 2015.(See below for descriptions.) Funded research projects My project titled " Synchrony-aware Primitives for Building Highly Auditable, Highly Scalable, Highly Available Distributed Systems " is funded by NSF XPS for $750,000 from 2015-2019. PI: Murat Demirbas and coPI: Sandeep Kulkarni. Auditability is a key property for developing highly scalable and highly available distributed systems; auditability enables identifying performance bottlenecks, dependencies among events, and latent concurrency bugs. In turn, for the auditability of a system, time is a key concept. However, there is a gap between the theory and the practice of distributed systems in terms of the use of time. The theory of distributed systems shunned the notion of time and considered asynchronous systems, whose event ordering is captured by logical clocks. The practical distributed systems employed NTP synchronized clocks to capture time but did so in ad hoc undisciplined ways. This project will bridge this gap and provide synchrony-aware system primitives that will support building highly auditable, highly scalable, and highly available distributed systems. The project has applications to cloud computing, distributed NewSQL databases, and globally distributed web services. My project titled " Scalable Coordination for Wide-Area Distributed Systems" is funded by NSF CSR for $500,000 from 2015-2018. PI: Murat Demirbas and coPI: Tevfik Kosar. Traditional distributed coordination techniques fail to scale for wide-area networks to support these new generation applications. Centralized coordination fails to scale with respect to the increased distances in the wide-area, whereas distributed coordination fails to scale with respect to the number of nodes involved. This research project claims that it is possible to achieve scalable coordination of distributed tasks over wide-area using a novel hybrid design, called Maestro. The Maestro framework will address the following research questions: (1) What are the limits of fully-centralized and fully-decentralized solutions to coordination, and what are the scalability benefits of a hybrid hierarchical approach? (2) How can locality-awareness be utilized to achieve high-performance across wide-area? (3) How can partition-awareness be utilized to achieve consistency across wide-area? Our project titled " PhoneLab: A Large-Scale Participatory Smartphone Testbed " is funded by a research infrastructure grant from NSF for $1.3 million in 2012. Geoffrey Challen (PI), Steve Ko, Chunming Qiao, Murat Demirbas, Tevfik Kosar. Project page is at http://www.phone-lab.org/ My project titled " An In-network Collaboration and Coordination Framework for Wireless Sensor Actor Networks " is funded by an NSF CAREER award (2008-2013). More information is available here. While there have been many efficient point solutions to the in-network processing problems in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), there has been little effort to address the underlying root research problem of devising an in-network collaboration and coordination framework that can achieve standardization and integration of in-network processing protocols. The objective of this project is to design and implement such a framework. This framework introduces a decentralized transactional model that enables a node to update the state of its singlehop neighborhood consistently and atomically. One of the key insights in this framework is to observe that singlehop wireless broadcast has many useful features for facilitating collaboration and coordination. By exploiting the atomicity and broadcast properties of singlehop wireless communication, the framework provides a simple/clean abstraction and yet manages to retain the efficiency of execution. Moreover, this project also investigates the practical uses of receiver-side collision detection in singlehop collaborative feedback collection in WSNs. By addressing the communication and concurrent execution challenges under the hood of its simple abstractions, the framework will provide a platform for developing and deploying distributed control applications as well as WSN in-network processing protocols. As such, this framework will be useful for multi-robot cooperative control applications and WSN-robotics integration for distributed sensing. More specifically, the framework will be demonstrated by developing a distributed multiple-pursuer/multiple-evader tracking application in WSNs. My project titled " Efficient and resilient querying and tracking services for wireless sensor networks " is funded by ONR (2009-2012) for 510K. A significant application of wireless sensor networks is in the area of intrusion detection and the related problem of querying and tracking of the location of the targets. Two major challenges facing querying and tracking services in wireless sensor networks are the scalability and reliability problems. To address these challenges, our project focuses on developing local and resilient services for querying and tracking under several WSN environments, namely, static, passively mobile, and actively mobile WSNs. My project titled " Tool-Support for Producing High-Assurance and Reliable Software for Wireless Sensor Actor Networks " is funded by NSF CSR (2009-2012). More information is available here. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been mainly used for data collection purposes, and have not been employed in the context of any consistency- or safety-critical applications. As such software development for WSNs has been done mostly on a best-effort basis. However, as WSNs get more integrated with actuation capabilities, the resulting wireless sensor actor networks (WSANs) require more assurance and survivability guarantees. The goal of this project is to design and implement the tool-support necessary for achieving assurance and reliability of WSANs software. The project will produce a transformation tool that allows programs for WSANs to be written in high-level models traditionally used to describe abstract distributed programs and automatically transforms these abstract programs, while preserving their correctness and reliability properties, into programs deployed in WSANs. The project will also develop a synthesis tool that manipulates the given abstract distributed programs for the automated addition of desired level of fault-tolerance. Finally, the project will design a framework that guards against the corruption of the auxiliary state introduced at the concrete system to ensure that the deployed program is verifiably reliable. I am a Co-Investigator on the project titled " 1R21ES017826: Use of cellphone-based time-activity data for air pollutant exposure estimation ", which is approved for funding 10/1/10-9/30/12 by NIH/NIEHS. Our goal is to design and demonstrate the feasibility of an efficient method to incorporate time-activity data measured with GPS-equipped "smart" cellphones into two models designed to estimate individual exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). PM2.5 is a traffic-related pollutant implicated in a wide variety of adverse health outcomes. We use the term cellphone-based exposure estimates to describe air pollutant exposure estimates based on cellphone-collected time-activity data. By using cellphone-based rather than residence-based estimates, we can greatly improve the accuracy with which we are able to estimate exposures in studying health effects of air pollution. In this proposed research project, we aim to do the following tasks: (1) To collect time-activity data for three months from 40 volunteers in the Buffalo/Niagara, New York region using GPS-equipped cellphones. We will compare these data to time-activity information collected using two 24-hour diaries. (2) To incorporate the cellphone-based time-activity data into land use regression and Kriging models to produce cellphone-based PM2.5 exposure estimates, and to compare these to residence-based estimates. (3) To design algorithms to optimize the efficiency of incorporating time-activity data into land use regression and Kriging models so that the method will be feasible to use in large study populations. My project titled " Crowdsourced sensing and collaboration using Twitter " is funded by a Google Research Award in 2010. Despite the ubiquitous availability of the sensor and smartphone devices, the-state-of-the-art falls short of the ubiquitous computing vision. We argue that the reason for this gap is the lack of an infrastructure to task/utilize these devices for collaboration. We propose that Twitter can provide an "open" publish-subscribe infrastructure for sensors and smartphones, and pave the way for crowdsourced sensing and collaboration applications. In our preliminary work, we designed and implemented a crowdsourced sensing system over Twitter, and deployed a crowdsourced weather radar using our system. Our results from this real-world Twitter experiment show promise for the feasibility of this approach. In this project, we propose to (1) solve the challenges in sensor/smartphone integration to Twitter (establishing sensor tweet standards, providing incentives, building filters, exploiting social networking features), (2) implement our crowdsourced sensing and collaboration system over Hadoop and deploy it on the cloud for elastic scalability, (3) deploy a participatory noise-mapping application on Android-based smartphones, and (4) design social collaboration applications and integrate with Google Latitude. Our project titled " PhoneLab: A Participatory Smartphone Cloud Testbed " is funded by a Google Research Award in 2011. Geoffrey Challen (PI), Murat Demirbas, Steve Ko, Tevfik Kosar. The expanding capabilities and growing number of smartphones are producing a new computing infrastructure integrating phones, users, and the Internet. We call this emerging device the phone cloud, and its power is transforming user expectations. The users now expect their phones to locate friends; identify the song playing at a restaurant; provide instant access to music, video, and other information; and help document their lives --- all in addition to placing phone calls and sending text messages. Meeting these expectations requires addressing multiple challenges: efficiently utilizing multiple radio technologies and integrated sensors, harnessing powerful processors to support demanding applications, and leveraging distributed storage to move data closer to users. Yet, despite the challenges and transformative nature of the phone cloud, no public testbed exists enabling large-scale realistic smartphone experimentation. We propose to develop PhoneLab, a new scientific instrument enabling smartphone operating system and mobile application research in a realistic environment at a scale not previously possible. PhoneLab will eventually consist of 1,000 reprogrammable Android devices deployed into the hands of UB students and staff, providing the power, scale, and realism necessary to enable mobile computing research. Our project titled " Two-Rank Mobile Robot Fleet for Swarm Surveillance, Warfighter Assistance and other Army-related Research and Research-Related Education " is funded by Army Research Office DURIP program for $290,000 in 2011.

faculty	Wen Dong Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science and Engineering Institute of Sustainable Transportation and Logistics SUNY at Buffalo 306 Davis Hall Buffalo, NY 14260 Phone: (716) 645-1589 Email: wendong at buffalo dot edu Spring 2017 office hours Tuesday 10:00am - noon I am actively recruiting PhD students Research Highlights Wen Dong focuses on modeling human interaction dynamics with stochastic process theory through combining the power of big data and the logic/reasoning power of state-of-the-art agent-based models, to solve our societies most challenging problems such as transportation sustainability and efficiency. His approach is to drive simulation games (alike SimCity) with petabyte-sized data exhaust trails of networked people to study our social systems and make decisions through playing the data-driven simulation games on super-computers (which solve the stochastic differential equations that describe the agent behavior). He has applied this approach to social systems of different sizes, ranging from the movement of millions of vehicle locations sampled every minute for years, the co-evolution of social network and individual behavior of different communities tracked by personal mobile phones and surveys, and Bales interaction process analysis of several individuals solving problems tracked by socio-metric badges. The applications have won both industrial and academic awards. Selected Publications Journal papers Tong Guan, Le Fang, Wen Dong, Dimitrios Koutsonikolas, Geoffrey Challen and Chunming Qiao.

School of Engineering and Applied Sciences University at Buffalo After more than a decade at Canisius College, I started as a Teaching Associate Professor at the University at Buffalo in the Fall of 2016. If you are interested in figuring out how I could fool 2 institutions into hiring me as a faculty member, you can examine my CV (and tell me how, too).

Research Poor Richard's Memory Manager I have been investigating simple methods to improve the paging performance of garbage collected applications. Unlike past approaches, these are designed to be fully automatic and require little-to-no changes to the existing GC, virtual machine, OS. or program. This has culminated in the creation of Poor Richard's Memory Manager . Using PRMM requires under 100 LoC be added to the existing virtual machine code. It has been used to optimize the paging performance of programs on dedicated machines and in multiprogrammed environments. We have shown that it works for a large variety of GC algorithms: from the BDW whole-heap non-moving collector to MMTk's high performing generational collectors.

CS Education I was lucky enough to have a number of wonderful teachers when I was first starting in computer science. I cannot emphasize enough the (postive!) impact they made on me. Upon my graduation, I was again lucky to find a school that values teaching undergraduates as much as research. On this vein, I am studying both how we teach computer science and ways that this teaching can be improved.

Virtual Memory Behavior In a recent study, I found that while copying garbage collection performance is competitive with explicit memory management, this holds only when memory is plentiful. More than just demanding larger heap sizes, garbage collection performance depends on the heap staying memory resident. In experiments with several commercial JVMs, I found that SPECjbb throughput decreases up to 66% once the heap no longer fits within available memory. To solve this problem, I have developed Bookmarking collection (BC) and implemented this within the Jikes RVM and MMTk. When memory pressure is low, BC matches or beats the performance of the next best collector I tested, GenMS. By cooperating with the VM when memory pressure increases, BC executes up to 5x faster than the next best collector and up to 41x faster than GenMS.

Merlin Merlin is the asymptotically optimal object lifetime computation algorithm I developed and implemented within a trace generator for the Jikes RVM. Leveraging the Merlin algorithm, perfectly accurate traces for all of the benchmarks in jolden can be generated in an afternoon (even using the optimizing compiler!) and traces of the SPEC JVM98 suite of programs requires a weekend. "Merlin traces" are being used/have been used in many places including: UMass, McGill University, Australian National University, and the Universities of Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Kent. My trace genertion code (which includes both the Merlin algorithm and slower "brute force" method for lifetime analysis) is now a part of MMTk and included in the Jikes RVM CVS tree.

Available from Kluwer. Garbage Collection Traces The first publication in which I was involved researched the pretenuring of objects. This research analyzed garbage collection traces to find object allocation sites that can be "pretenured" --- or allocated into longer-lived regions. Using our pretenuring algorithm a program's performance can be improved up to 20%! My Master's project examined the effects granulated garbage collection traces have on simulator fidelity. I found that "granulated" traces (traces that accurately compute which objects are unreachable only after every k bytes of allocation) significantly affect simulator results. While there were methods that may limit the impact of trace granularity, only perfectly accurate traces can guarantee accurate simulations. Publications Profile-based Pretenuring , Stephen M.

Dissertation For a good detailed look of the different topics I tackled in graduate school (and continue to interest me to this day), you can look through my doctoral thesis. While not as large as some, be warned this file is large. Thesis Quantifying and Improving the Performance of Garbage Collection , Matthew Hertz , Ph.D. Thesis, September 1, 2006. Older First In my first few years of graduate school, I implemented the Older First (OF) garbage collection algorithm within the UMass JVM, the Jalapeno virtual machine, and GCTk for the Jikes RVM. While Darko Stefanovic developed the OF algorithm, I have made several implementation optimizations when I coded it for inclusion with GCTk. I also developed the N - M aturing O lder F irst (NMOF) collector which improves the initial OF design by moving objects that survive several collections into a mature object space. While the performance of NMOF has not formally studied, informal analysis suggests NMOF reduces the work OF performs (as measured by the mark-cons ratio). Publications Older-first Garbage Collection in Practice: Evaluation in a Java Virtual Machine , Darko Stefanovic, Matthew Hertz , Steve M. Blackburn, K. S. McKinley, and J. Eliot B. Moss, Memory System Performance, Berlin, Germany, June 16, 2002. Compiler Optimizations I am very interested in compiler optimizations, especially in compiler optimizations for garbage collection. While I have not yet published anything in this area, I spent the summer of 2002 working as a graduate intern at Sun Labs implementing new compiler optimizations for garbage collection within HotSpot.

Databases, query compilers, data structures, algorithms, systems, implementation, and visualization. Were interested in everything to do with storing, retrieving, and interpreting data. Our ultimate goal is to make data accessible, understandable, and comprehensible to anyone and everyone. Agility Real-world workloads change over time, often unpredictably. Static choices made by traditional cost-based query optimizers, physical layout designers, or query execution engines rarely allow for the possibility that assumptions made early on will change. We explore data structures, algorithms and programming techniques that enable [database] systems to be flexible enough to adapt to changing workloads. Uncertainty Data is rarely complete, precise or certain. With data sizes growing and data rates getting faster, attempts at shielding analysts from uncertainty in data are becoming harder and harder to maintain. The need to make uncertainty a first-class programming primitive is growing, so we explore ways of exposing it to users in a way that is not only comprehensive, but understandable.

Evolved biological systems reliably work in random, unstructured, and fluctuating environments, and often do so with a baffling lack of global information, planning, and communication. Their approaches seems to focus on self-organization, managing noise created by many interacting components, and using distributed reactive behaviors as feedback to adapt their strategies. Can we build systems with similarly robust behavior? Currently, I am applying these biological guiding principles to robotic construction, specifically, termite inspired construction algorithms that cope with unstructured terrain and disturbances by exploiting a combination of reactive behaviors and compliant construction materials. My thesis work focused on tuning local behaviors to reliably achieve predictable global behavior from unreliable or stochastic components. I have built and worked with several robotic test-beds to develop, refine, and test these control strategies. Projects Molecular Machine Learning (Current) Machine learning is revolutionizing a number of scientific and engineering disciplines by efficiently extracting information from noisy and uncertain data, e.g. computer vision, medical screening, and model/parameter learning from vast amounts of data. Systems Biology and other engineering disciplines that aim to design complex behaviors on a molecular level are currently plagued by noise and component uncertainty. The goal of this ongoing project is to bring the algorithmic tools that are so successful when implemented on computers to the molecular realm. Initial results focus on how fundamental and general machine learning algorithms, like belief propagation on graphical models, can be implemented by molecular sytems. Amorphous Robotic Construction (Current) This project aims to create algorithms and hardware that can reliably build structures in unstructured terrain. Some animals, e.g. mound building termites, are really good at this type of construction. Their skill depends on the tightly coupled interaction of construction strategy and construction material. Termites and other animals often take advantage of goopy, amorphous materials to build in irregularly shaped environments. From a robotics perspective, this approach is appealing since mechanical feedback during construction not only makes the process robust but potentially allows for much coarser control and sensing requirements of the construction mechanism. The robots I am working on use polyurethane foam as amorphous construction material. Depositions are modeled as operator applications to continuous functions, and robust strategies are designed to always reach desirable invariant sets after a finite number of depositions. Movies: Simulation of robot (blue circle) building a large ramp. [avi] (3.5 mb) Foam deposition mechanism creating a ramp. [mp4] (4.1 mb) Factory Floor The Factory Floor Testbed is an experiment to explore scalable, robust, multi robot construction hardware and algorithms. It consists of modular robots that can build arbitrary lattice structures from two types of raw materials. The hardware is built by the ( ModLab ) at the University of Pennsylvania. My role in the project is the design of models and robust construction algorithms for the testbed. Movies: Simulation of Factory Floor Testbed building a chair. [avi] (4.9 mb) Robotic Chemistry The Robotic Chemistry Testbed is physical instantiation of a tunable Stochastic Chemical Reaction Network. It consists of three types of simple robots that are randomly stirred on an air table. They are machined from polyurethane foam with embedded magnets. One type of robot has an analog circuit connected to solar cells that allow it to collect energy and break apart the dimers formed by the other two robot types. In this project I helped with the initial design and advised a team of undergraduate students with the detailed design and construction. Movies: Active robot disassembling a dimer. [avi] (1.1 mb) Testbed observed via overhead camera (2x real time). [avi] (3.3 mb) Programmable Parts The Programmable Parts Testbed is a stochastic self assembly experiment. Triangular robots are randomly stirred on an air table so that their motion cannot be directly controlled by the experimentor. However, the robots binding behavior with respect to other robots can be controlled by specifying local rules as a graph grammar. We showed how to create grammars to build arbitrary shapes by using the testbed as an instantiation of a Stochastic Chemical Reaction network. I did most of the electrical and mechanical design work for these robots as well as writing the embedded control software for interpreting graph grammars.

faculty	Rohini K. Srihari Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering University at Buffalo, The State University of New York Biography: Rohini Srihari is an educator, computer scientist and enterpreneur. Her work has spanned the areas of artificial intelligence, multimedia information retrieval, computational linguistics and text mining. She is an author of over 150 papers in computer science, including two US patents, which are well-cited (h-index > 30) and supervised ten doctoral dissertations . Most recently she has been writing technology articles for the general public, e.g., internet of everything , personalized marketing , etc. She founded several natural language technology companies, including: (i) Cymfony (CEO 1996-2001, Chief Scientist 2001-2005). Cymfony became the leading market analytics company and was acquired by TNS. (ii) Janya (CEO 2005-2012) a provider of information extraction technology to the government, and (iii) Content Savvy Inc (CEO, 2011-2014), which powers content analytics from a range of news, social media, and custom data sources to enhance business decision making. Content Savvy was acquired by Smart Focus in 2014. Dr. Srihari received a B. Math. in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo , Ontario, Canada, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo in 1992 for a dissertation on using collateral text in interpreting photographs. She was named Best Woman in Technology by Infotech-Niagara for 2015. Previously she was named to the Women of Accomplishment Legacy Project that identified "outstanding women of the 20th and 21st century of Western New York." Itemized Lists: PUBLICATIONS TALKS/INTERVIEWS DOCTORAL STUDENTS COMMITTEES MEDIA ARTICLES Research: My computer science work has focused on (i) multilingual text mining, (ii) multi-document summarization, (iii) social media mining, and (iv) mining e-learning forums. Some of these are described below: The work in multilingual text mining is focused on languages that are less commonly taught (LCTL). These languages are characterized by the lack of critical resources such as electronic dictionaries, annotated corpora (for training machine learning modules) and other rich resources used in English NLP such as WordNet. We adapted resources from other languages to automatically generate critical tools and data resources and used transfer learning to project English semantic role labels (from PropBank) to an Urdu corpus. We also showed how Hindi resources could be adapted for this task. Finally, some work on Urdu sentiment analysis, namely identifying opinion entities has demonstrated the need for different features when compared to English. Another effort was on multilingual text mining for languages such as Chinese, Arabic, Russian and Pashto in an attempt to support intelligence community initiatives. Since 1997, I have been actively working in information extraction (IE), a discipline that is at the intersection of linguistics and computer science. IE concerns the ability to extract salient information such as entities, relationships between entities, and events from large collections of unstructured text. I have been involved in applications of IE including question-answering-- focusing on a hybrid approach to IE that combines statistical machine learning with grammar and lexicon-based approaches. The Semantex text mining platform is the culmination of over a decade of funded research in this area and has led to numerous publications and invited talks. It is being used by both government and industry in a variety of text-processing applications. The recent focus has been on using semi-supervised learning in order to facilitate domain porting. Special topics I have been pursuing include temporal and location normalization, massive scalability, entity/name disambuiguation, and processing of noisy text such as chat and blog data.

faculty	Bioinformatics Laboratory Home Projects Publications Machine Learning Bioinformatics Software People Openings Contact Previous Next 1 2 3 4 Previous Next While high-throughput genomics technologies are revolutionizing many aspects of modern biology, it is now clear that the lack of computational algorithms and resources for analyzing massive data generated by these techniques has become a rate-limiting factor for scientific discoveries in biology research. We study machine learning, data mining, bioinformatics, and their applications to cancer informatics and microbial ecology. The main focus of our current research is on developing advanced algorithms to help biologists keep pace with the unprecedented growth of genomics datasets available today and enable them to make full use of their massive, high-dimensional data for various biological enquiries. Our work is based on solid mathematical and statistical theories, and supported by National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Bankhead-Coley Cancer Foundation, Susan Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and SUNY Research Foundation. Our work on metagenomics and high-dimensional data analysis has been used by more than 200 research institutes worldwide. We are always looking for talented people to join our team. If you have strong training on mathematics and computer science and are interested in using your computational skills to address challenging scientific problems, you may want to send an email to Dr. Yijun Sun. Patience and diligence, like faith, remove mountains. - William Penn (1644-1718)

faculty	By recursively applying our composition theorems, we obtain a nearly optimal $\tilde{O}(n^{1-2^{-d}})$ upper bound on the quantum query complexity and approximate degree of linear-size depth-$d$ AC$^0$ circuits. As a consequence, such circuits can be PAC learned in subexponential time, even in the challenging agnostic setting. Prior to our work, a subexponential-time algorithm was not known even for linear-size depth-3 AC$^0$ circuits. We also show that any substantially faster learning algorithm will require fundamentally new techniques. Second, for any $\delta>0$, we exhibit a function $f \colon \{-1, 1\}^n \to \{-1, 1\}$ that is computed by a circuit of depth $O(1/\delta)$ and is hard to approximate by polynomials in the following sense: $f$ cannot be uniformly approximated to error $\epsilon=1-2^{-\Omega(n^{1-\delta})}$, even by polynomials of degree $n^{1-\delta}$. Our recent prior work (Bun and Thaler, FOCS 2017) proved a similar lower bound, but which held only for error $\epsilon=1/3$. Our result implies $2^{\Omega(n^{1-\delta})}$ lower bounds on the complexity of AC$^0$ under a variety of basic measures such as discrepancy, margin complexity, and threshold weight. This nearly matches the trivial upper bound of $2^{O(n)}$ that holds for every function. The previous best lower bound on AC$^0$ for these measures was $2^{\Omega(n^{1/2})}$ (Sherstov, FOCS 2015). Additional applications in learning theory, communication complexity, and cryptography are described. Our argument is public coin, so we apply the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to produce a zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zkSNARK), which we call Hyrax. We evaluate Hyrax on three benchmarks: SHA-256 Merkle trees, image transformation, and matrix multiplication. We find that Hyrax's proofs are 210x smaller than prior work with similar properties, and that Hyrax scales to 627x larger circuits than a highly-optimized prior system that requires trusted setup. We resolve or nearly resolve the approximate degree and quantum query complexities of several basic functions. Specifically, we show the following: We take a step toward showing that all of these complexity measures indeed exhibit a chasm at depth three. Specifically, for any arbitrarily small constant $\delta > 0$, we exhibit a depth three circuit of polynomial size (in fact, an $O(\log n)$-decision list) of complexity $\exp(\Omega(n^{1/2-\delta}))$ under each of these measures. Our methods go beyond the block-composed functions studied in prior work, and hence may not be subject to the same barriers. In particular, we suggest natural candidate functions that may exhibit stronger bounds, of the form $\exp(\tilde{\Omega}(n))$, where the notation hides factors polylogarithmic in $n$. This paper describes a new VA system, called Giraffe; charges Giraffe for all three costs; and identifies regimes where outsourcing is worthwhile. Giraffes base is an interactive proof geared to data parallel computation. Giraffe makes this protocol asymptotically optimal for the prover, which is of independent interest. Giraffe also develops a design template that produces hardware designs automatically for a wide range of parameters, introduces hardware primitives molded to the protocols data flows, and incorporates program analyses that expand applicability. Giraffe wins even when outsourcing several tens of sub-computations, scales to 500x larger computations than prior work, and can profitably outsource parts of programs that are not worthwhile to outsource in full. Our algorithm improves on two theoretical and practical aspects of prior work. First, it handles weighted updates in amortized constant time, a common requirement in practice. Second, it uses a simple and fast method for merging summaries that asymptotically improves on prior work even for unweighted streams. We describe experiments confirming that our algorithms are more efficient than prior proposals. Specifically, we show how to transform any Boolean function $f$ with approximate degree $d$ into a function $F$ on $O(n \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$ variables with approximate degree at least $D = \Omega(n^{1/3} \cdot d^{2/3})$. In particular, if $d= n^{1-\Omega(1)}$, then $D$ is polynomially larger than $d$. Moreover, if $f$ is computed by a polynomial-size Boolean circuit of constant depth, then so is $F$. By recursively applying our transformation, for any constant $\delta > 0$ we exhibit an AC$^0$ function of approximate degree $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$. This improves over the best previous lower bound of $\Omega(n^{2/3})$ due to Aaronson and Shi (J. ACM 2004), and nearly matches the trivial upper bound of $n$ that holds for any function. Our lower bounds also apply to (quasipolynomial-size) DNFs of polylogarithmic width. We describe several applications of these results. We give: The technical core of our results is a stronger hardness amplification theorem for approximate degree, which roughly says that composing the gapped-majority function with any function of high approximate degree yields a function with high threshold degree. The algorithm runs in polynomial-time (in $n$) with respect to any distribution on $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ (the unit sphere in $n$ dimensions) and for any error parameter $\epsilon=\Omega(1/\log n)$ (this yields a PTAS for a question raised by F. Bach on the complexity of maximizing ReLUs). These results are in contrast to known efficient algorithms for reliably learning linear threshold functions, where $\epsilon$ must be $\Omega(1)$ and strong assumptions are required on the marginal distribution. We can compose our results to obtain the first set of efficient algorithms for learning constant-depth networks of ReLUs. Our techniques combine kernel methods and polynomial approximations with a "dual-loss" approach to convex programming. As a byproduct we obtain a number of applications including the first set of efficient algorithms for "convex piecewise-linear fitting" and the first efficient algorithms for noisy polynomial reconstruction of low-weight polynomials on the unit sphere. We initiate the study of these challenges by examining one concrete problem in particular: how to algorithmically generate contest payout structures that are 1) economically motivating and appealing to contestants and 2) reasonably structured and succinctly representable. We formalize this problem and present a general two-staged approach for producing satisfying payout structures given constraints on contest size, entry fee, prize bucketing, etc. We then propose and evaluate several potential algorithms for solving the payout problem efficiently, including methods based on dynamic programming, integer programming, and heuristic techniques. Experimental results show that a carefully designed heuristic scales very well, even to contests with over 100,000 prize winners. Our approach extends beyond fantasy sports -- it is suitable for generating engaging payout structures for any contest with a large number of entrants and a large number of prize winners, including other massive online games, poker tournaments, and real-life sports tournaments. More recently, several open problems in the study of approximate degree have been resolved via the construction of dual polynomials. These are explicit dual solutions to an appropriate linear program that captures the approximate degree of any function. We reprove Aaronson and Shi's results by constructing explicit dual polynomials for the Collision and Element Distinctness functions. We prove a generalization of Razborov and Sherstov's result, yielding exponential sign-rank lower bounds for a non-trivial class of functions (that includes the function used by Razborov and Sherstov). As a corollary of our general result, we improve Razborov and Sherstov's lower bound on the sign-rank of AC$^0$ from $\exp(\Omega(n^{1/3}))$ to $\exp(\tilde{\Omega}(n^{2/5}))$. We also describe several applications to communication complexity, learning theory, and circuit complexity. Unlike related prior work, our result implies strong approximate degree lower bounds even for many functions $F$ that have low threshold degree. Our proof is constructive: we exhibit a solution to the dual of an appropriate linear program capturing the approximate degree of any function. In the annotated data streaming model of Chakrabarti et al., a computationally limited client wants to compute some property of a massive input, but lacks the resources to store even a small fraction of the input, and hence cannot perform the desired computation locally. The client therefore accesses a powerful but untrusted service provider, who not only performs the requested computation, but also proves that the answer is correct. We put forth the notion of semi-streaming algorithms for annotated graph streams (semi-streaming annotation schemes for short). These are protocols in which both the client's space usage and the length of the proof are $O(n \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$. We give evidence that semi-streaming annotation schemes represent a substantially more robust solution concept than does the standard semi-streaming model. On the positive side, we give semi-streaming annotation schemes for two dynamic graph problems that are intractable in the standard model: (exactly) counting triangles, and (exactly) computing maximum matchings. The former scheme answers a question of Cormode. On the negative side, we identify for the first time two natural graph problems (connectivity and bipartiteness in a certain edge update model) that can be solved in the standard semi-streaming model, but cannot be solved by annotation schemes of "sub-semi-streaming" cost. That is, these problems are just as hard in the annotations model as they are in the standard model. To the authors' knowledge, these are the first hardness results for sparse regression that apply when the algorithm simultaneously has $k'>k$ and $h(m,p)>0$. Our techniques also yield a new lower bound of $\Omega\left(n^{1/2}/\log^{(d-2)/2}(n)\right)$ on the approximate degree of the AND-OR tree of depth $d$, which is tight up to polylogarithmic factors for any constant $d$, as well as new bounds for read-once DNF formulas. In turn, these results imply new lower bounds on the communication and circuit complexity of these classes, and demonstrate strong limitations on existing PAC learning algorithms. In this work we study "barely interactive" SIPs. Specifically, we show that two or three rounds of interaction suffice to solve several query problems --- including Index, Median, Nearest Neighbor Search, Pattern Matching, and Range Counting---with polylogarithmic space and communication costs. Such efficiency with $O(1)$ rounds of interaction was thought to be impossible based on previous work. On the other hand, we initiate a formal study of the limitations of constant-round SIPs by introducing a new hierarchy of communication models called Online Interactive Proofs (OIPs). The online nature of these models is analogous to the streaming restriction placed upon the verifier in an SIP. We give upper and lower bounds that (1) characterize, up to quadratic blowups, every finite level of the OIP hierarchy in terms of other well-known communication complexity classes, (2) separate the first four levels of the hierarchy, and (3) reveal that the hierarchy collapses to the fourth level. Our study of OIPs reveals marked contrasts and some parallels with the classic Turing Machine theory of interactive proofs, establishes limits on the power of existing techniques for developing constant-round SIPs, and provides a new characterization of (non-online) Arthur-Merlin communication in terms of an online model. This paper initiates the study of the practical efficiency of multiprover interactive proofs (MIPs). We present a new MIP for delegating computation that extends insights from a powerful IP protocol (Goldwasser et al., STOC, 2008). Without reductions or amplification, our protocol uses only two provers (departing from prior work on MIPs), and achieves both the efficiency of interactive proof-based protocols and the generality of argument system-based protocols. Also, this result, together with recently developed machinery, creates a potential avenue toward concretely efficient arguments without setup costs. We describe Clover, a built system for verifiable computation, based on our protocol. Although Clover does not implement the full theory (it has setup costs), it applies to problems that existing IPs cannot efficiently handle, and achieves performance comparable to, or better than, the best argument systems. For distribution-independent learning, the best known algorithms for PAC learning typically utilize polynomial threshold representations, while the state of the art agnostic learning algorithms use point-wise polynomial approximations. We show that one-sided polynomial approximations, an intermediate notion between polynomial threshold representations and point-wise polynomial approximations, suffice for learning in the reliable agnostic settings. We then show that majorities can be fully reliably learned and disjunctions of majorities can be positive reliably learned, through constructions of appropriate one-sided polynomial approximations. Our fully reliable algorithm for majorities provides the first evidence that fully reliable learning may be strictly easier than agnostic learning. Our algorithms also satisfy strong attribute-efficiency properties, and in many cases they provide smooth tradeoffs between sample complexity and running time. We derive our representation for the database by approximating the OR function restricted to low Hamming weight inputs using low-degree polynomials with coefficients of bounded $L_1$-norm. In doing so, we show new upper and lower bounds on the degree of such polynomials, which may be of independent approximation-theoretic interest. A rich theory of such algorithms---which we call schemes---has emerged. Prior work has shown how to leverage the prover's power to efficiently solve problems that have no non-trivial standard data stream algorithms. However, while optimal schemes are now known for several basic problems, such optimality holds only for streams whose length is commensurate with the size of the data universe. In contrast, many real-world datasets are relatively sparse, including graphs that contain only $O(n^2)$ edges, and IP traffic streams that contain much fewer than the total number of possible IP addresses, $2^{128}$ in IPv6. We design the first schemes that allow both the annotation and the space usage to be sublinear in the total number of stream updates rather than the size of the data universe. We solve significant problems, including variations of INDEX, SET-DISJOINTNESS, and FREQUENCY-MOMENTS, plus several natural problems on graphs. On the other hand, we give a new lower bound that, for the first time, rules out smooth tradeoffs between annotation and space usage for a specific problem. Our technique brings out new nuances in Merlin-Arthur communication complexity models, and provides a separation between online versions of the MA and AMA models. We describe a refinement of a powerful interactive proof protocol originally due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum. Cormode, Mitzenmacher, and Thaler show how to implement the prover in this protocol in time $O(S \log S)$, where $S$ is the size of an arithmetic circuit computing the function of interest. Our refinements apply to circuits whose wiring pattern is sufficiently "regular"; for these circuits, we bring the runtime of the prover down to $O(S)$. That is, our prover can evaluate the circuit with a guarantee of correctness, with only a constant-factor blowup in work compared to evaluating the circuit with no guarantee. We argue that our refinements capture a large class of circuits, and prove some theorems formalizing this. Experimentally, our refinements yield a 200x speedup for the prover over the implementation of Cormode et al., and our prover is less than 10x slower than a C++ program that simply evaluates the circuit. Along the way, we describe a special-purpose protocol for matrix multiplication that is of interest in its own right. Our final contribution is a protocol targeted at general data parallel computation. Compared to prior work, this protocol can more efficiently verify complicated computations as long as that computation is applied independently to many pieces of data. We give an algorithm that runs in time $d^{O(\sqrt{k})}$ and releases a private summary capable of answering any $k$-way marginal query with at most $\pm .01$ error on every query as long as $n \geq d^{O(\sqrt{k})}$. To our knowledge, ours is the first algorithm capable of privately releasing marginal queries with non-trivial worst-case accuracy guarantees in time substantially smaller than the number of $k$-way marginal queries, which is $d^{\Theta(k)}$ (for $k \ll d$). Our main positive result is a new tradeoff between the running time and mistake bound for learning length-$k$ decision lists over $n$ Boolean variables. When the allowed running time is relatively high, our new mistake bound improves significantly on the mistake bound of the best previous algorithm of Klivans and Servedio. Our main negative result is a new lower bound on the weight of any degree-$d$ polynomial threshold function (PTF) that computes a particular decision list over $k$ variables (the ``Odd-Max-Bit'' function). The main result of Beigel (Computational Complexity, 1994) is a weight lower bound of $2^{\Omega(k/d^2)}$, which was shown to be essentially optimal for $d \leq k^{1/3}$ by Klivans and Servedio. Here we prove a $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{k/d})}$ lower bound, which improves on Beigel's lower bound for $d > k^{1/3}.$ This lower bound establishes strong limitations on the effectiveness of the Klivans and Servedio approach and suggests that it may be difficult to improve on our positive result. The main tool used in our lower bound is a new variant of Markov's classical inequality which may be of independent interest; it provides a bound on the derivative of a univariate polynomial in terms of both its degree and the size of its coefficients. In this paper, we make note of an interesting aspect of these types of processes: the results are generally the same when the randomness is structured in the manner of double hashing. This phenomenon allows us to use less randomness and simplify the implementation for several hash-based data structures and algorithms. We explore this approach from both an empirical and theoretical perspective, examining theoretical justifications as well as simulation results for specific problems. Our goal is to leverage GPUs to reduce the server-side slowdown for verifiable computation. To this end, we identify abundant data parallelism in a state-of-the-art general-purpose protocol for verifiable computation, originally due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum, and recently extended by Cormode, Mitzenmacher, and Thaler. We implement this protocol on the GPU, obtaining 40-120x server-side speedups relative to a state-of-the-art sequential implementation. For benchmark problems, our implementation reduces the slowdown of the server to factors of 100-500x relative to the original computations requested by the client. Furthermore, we reduce the already small runtime of the client by 100x. Similarly, we obtain 20-50x server-side and client-side speedups for related protocols targeted at specific streaming problems. We believe our results demonstrate the immediate practicality of using GPUs for verifiable computation, and more generally that protocols for verifiable computation have become sufficiently mature to deploy in real cloud computing systems. We give precise characterizations of the threshold between finite and infinite capacity depending on the interference behavior and on the type of channel adversary: for max-bounded delay, the threshold is at $D_{\text{max}}=\Theta(M \log\min{k, M}))$, and for average bounded delay the threshold is at $D_{\text{avg}} = \Theta(\sqrt{M \cdot \min\{k, M\}})$. Our approach is two-fold. First, we describe a carefully chosen instantiation of one of the most efficient general-purpose constructions for arbitrary computations (streaming or otherwise), due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum. This requires several new insights to make the methodology more practical. Our main contribution is in achieving a prover who runs in time $O(S(n) \log S(n))$, where $S(n)$ is the size of an arithmetic circuit computing the function of interest. Our experimental results demonstrate that a practical general-purpose protocol for verifiable computation may be significantly closer to reality than previously realized. Second, we describe techniques that achieve genuine scalability for protocols fine-tuned for specific important problems in streaming and database processing. Focusing in particular on non-interactive protocols for problems ranging from matrix-vector multiplication to bipartite perfect matching, we build on prior work to achieve a prover who runs in nearly linear-time, while obtaining optimal tradeoffs between communication cost and the user's working memory. Existing techniques required (substantially) superlinear time for the prover. We argue that even if general-purpose methods improve, fine-tuned protocols will remain valuable in real-world settings for key problems, and hence special attention to specific problems is warranted.

faculty	Daljit Singh Dhillon Website under construction. Assistant Professor, Visual Computing School of Computing 303 McAdams Hall Email-id: djsingh AT clemson DOT edu Research Interests Computer graphics, realistic appearances, bio-physical modeling and simulation, surface geometries, fabrication Students interested in undertaking research work in these areas are welcome to contact Dr. Dhillon Short Bio Dr. Daljit Singh Dhillon in an assistant professor with the division for Visual Computing at Clemson University , since Jan 2019. Previously, he was a research associate at Realistic Graphics and Imaging Group , Imperial College London (ICL), UK from 2017 - 2018. His primary research interest lies in modeling material appearances and surface geometric phenomena. He has a keen interest in inter-disciplinary research involving visual computing, especially in material fabrication. His association with ICL began as a visiting researcher (2016 - 2017) on a Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) fellowship for a post-doc position. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science from University of Bern , Switzerland (2011-2015). His PhD thesis On Modeling and Simulating Reptile Skin Coloration was an inter-disciplinary research work in collaboration with biologists and physicists at University of Geneva , Switzerland. Dr. Dhillon obtained his M.Sc. (Engg.) degree with a research thesis on structured-light 3D scanning systems, from Indian Institute of Science (2007-2010) and a bachelor degree in computer engineering from University of Mumbai (1995-1999). Apart from an academic research background in computer graphics and vision, he has eight years of industrial experience in software development (1999-2007), including research in video encoders and speaker verification using Hidden Markov Models. Publications Peer-reviewed Journals Acquiring Spatially-varying Appearance of Printed Holographic Surfaces Toisoul, A.* , Dhillon, D.S.J.*, and Ghosh, A. (2018), in ACM Trans. on Graphics (Proc. SIGGRAPH ASIA) 37, 6, Article 272, 16 pages. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/3272127.3275077 , * joint first authors We present two novel and complimentary approaches to measure diffraction effects in commonly found planar spatially varying holographic surfaces. Such surfaces are increasingly found in various decorative materials such as gift bags, holographic papers, clothing and security holograms, and produce impressive visual effects that have not been previously acquired for realistic rendering. Such holographic surfaces are usually manufactured with one dimensional diffraction gratings that are varying in periodicity and orientation over an entire sample in order to produce a wide range of diffraction effects such as gradients and kinematic (rotational) effects. Our proposed methods estimate these two parameters and allow an accurate reproduction of these effects in real-time. The first method simply uses a point light source to recover both the grating periodicity and orientation in the case of regular and stochastic textures. Under the assumption that the sample is made of the same repeated diffractive tile, good results can be obtained using just one to five photographs on a wide range of samples. The second method is based on polarization imaging and enables an independent high resolution measurement of the grating orientation and relative periodicity at each surface point. The method requires a minimum of four photographs for accurate results, does not assume repetition of an exemplar tile, and can even reveal minor fabrication defects. We present point light source renderings with both approaches that qualitatively match photographs, as well as real-time renderings under complex environmental illumination. Bifurcation Analysis of Reaction Diffusion Systems on Arbitrary Surfaces Dhillon, D.S., Milinkovitch, M.C., and Zwicker, M. (2017), in Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, 79: 788827 DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11538-017-0255-8 In this paper, we present computational techniques to investigate the effect of surface geometry on biological pattern formation. In particular, we study twocomponent, nonlinear reactiondiffusion (RD) systems on arbitrary surfaces. We build on standard techniques for linear and nonlinear analysis of RD systems and extend them to operate on large-scale meshes for arbitrary surfaces. In particular, we use spectral techniques for a linear stability analysis to characterise and directly compose patterns emerging from homogeneities. We develop an implementation using surface finite element methods and a numerical eigenanalysis of the LaplaceBeltrami operator on surface meshes. In addition, we describe a technique to explore solutions of the nonlinear RD equations using numerical continuation. Here, we present a multiresolution approach that allows us to trace solution branches of the nonlinear equations efficiently even for large-scale meshes. Finally, we demonstrate the working of our framework for two RD systems with applications in biological pattern formation: a Brusselator model that has been used to model pattern development on growing plant tips, and a chemotactic model for the formation of skin pigmentation patterns. While these models have been used previously on simple geometries, our framework allows us to study the impact of arbitrary geometries on emerging patterns. Interactive Diffraction from Biological Nanostructures Dhillon, D.S., Teyssier, J., Single, M., Gaponenko, I., Milinkovitch, M.C., and Zwicker, M. (2014), in Computer Graphics Forum (Vol. 33, No. 8, pp. 177-188), orally presented at Eurographics 2015, Zurich DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cgf.12425 We describe a technique for interactive rendering of diffraction effects produced by biological nanostructures, such as snake skin surface gratings. Our approach uses imagery from atomic force microscopy that accurately captures the geometry of the nanostructures responsible for structural colouration, that is, colouration due to wave interference, in a variety of animals. We develop a rendering technique that constructs bidirectional reflection distribution functions (BRDFs) directly from the measured data and leverages pre-computation to achieve interactive performance. We demonstrate results of our approach using various shapes of the surface grating nanostructures. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of our pre-computation-based technique and compare to a reference BRDF construction technique. Geometric and Radiometric Estimation in a Structured-light 3D Scanner Dhillon, D.S., and Govindu, V.M. (2015), in Machine Vision and Applications, 26(2-3), 339-352 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00138-015-0667-0 The key problems in a structured-light 3D scanner using a projector and camera are its geometric and radiometric calibration. A projector can be effectively represented using the familiar pin-hole model for cameras. However, since we cannot directly observe the projector plane, it cannot be calibrated like a camera. The first contribution of our paper is to develop a geometric calibration and 3D estimation method that utilises the projective geometric relationships available in a projectorcamera pair, i.e., homography induced by a plane and invariance of cross-ratios. The low-dimensional parametric form of the homography averages out individual errors, resulting in a geometric calibration approach that is both simple to use and highly accurate. We present an extensive set of results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and also characterise its accuracy. Second, we present a method for correcting systematic errors introduced due to the radiometric non-linearities present in commercial projectors. These errors are pronounced when only a few phase shifts are used in the sinusoidal coding scheme for structured-light scanners. We develop a cubic spline-based method to model and remove the effects due to these non-linearities. The efficacy of our model is demonstrated on real datasets. Crocodile Head Scales Are Not Developmental Units But Emerge from Physical Cracking Milinkovitch, M.C., Manukyan, L., Debry, A., Di-Po, N., Martin, S., Singh, D., Lambert, D., and Zwicker, M. (2013), in Science, 339(6115), 78-81 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1226265 Various lineages of amniotes display keratinized skin appendages (feathers, hairs, and scales) that differentiate in the embryo from genetically controlled developmental units whose spatial organization is patterned by reaction-diffusion mechanisms (RDMs). We show that, contrary to skin appendages in other amniotes (as well as body scales in crocodiles), face and jaws scales of crocodiles are random polygonal domains of highly keratinized skin, rather than genetically controlled elements, and emerge from a physical self-organizing stochastic process distinct from RDMs: cracking of the developing skin in a stress field. We suggest that the rapid growth of the crocodile embryonic facial and jaw skeleton, combined with the development of a very keratinized skin, generates the mechanical stress that causes cracking.

In addition, the database contains background information on all TDs (Teachta Dla, members of parliament), such as their party affiliations, constituencies and office positions. The current version of the database includes close to 4.5 million speeches from 1,236 TDs. Data collection: The speeches were downloaded from the official parliament website and further processed and parsed with a Python script. Background information on TDs was collected from the member database of the parliament website. Data on cabinet positions (ministers and junior ministers) was collected from the official website of the government. A record linkage algorithm and human coders were used to match TDs and ministers. Acknowledgments: The data collection was supported in part by the Irish Research Council for Humanities and the Social Sciences. The Institute for International Integration Studies (IIIS) at Trinity College Dublin provided research facilities for parts of the project. Citation: Alexander Herzog and Slava Mikhaylov.

I received my Bachelor and Master degree in Computer Science at the University of Genova , in 2008 and 2010, respectively. I started my PhD in 2011 under the supervision of Professor Leila De FLoriani . During Fall 2012 I've been a visiting PhD student at the University of Maryland collaborating with Kenneth Weiss and, successively, Patricio Simari . In 2014 I got my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Genova defending a thesis on "Multi-resolution shape analysis based on discrete Morse decompositions". From September 2014 to June 2016 I have been a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, at College Park. In July 2016 I joined the Geographical Sciences Department as a research fellow working in the Center for Geospatial Information Science focusing in geospatial data analysis and visualization. From January 2018 to July 2018 I have been a visiting researcher at Queens College (City University of New York), working with Dr. Chao Chen at the intersection of machine learning and topological data analysis. Currently I am an assistant professor in the School of Computing at Clemson University. My research interesets include Data visualization: scalar field and multivariate data analysis Topological Data Analysis: discrete Morse theory, persistent homology, multidimensional persistence Data structures: multiresolution models, simplicial complexes, spatial indexes News New! I am looking for motivated students. Drop me a line if interested Back from IEEE VIS 2018 2018/10/27 I presented our work on discrete Morse approaches for multipersistence computation at the Dagstuhl Seminar 18422 2018/10/16 I gave a talk at the UMI-SIMAI-PTM joint meeting in Wroclaw, Poland 2018/09/17 I joined the School of Computing at Clemson University as assistant professor 2018/08/15 I presented our work on the efficient computation of multipersistent homology at the SIAM conference on imaging science 2018/06/06 I presented our work on the toplogical analysis of biomedical images at the SIAM conference on imaging science 2018/06/06 I am on the program committee of the 26th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems ( SIGSPATIAL2018 ) 2018/05/20 I am on the program committee of the Smart Tools and Applications in Graphics conference ( STAG ) 2018/03/22 I moved to Dr. Chao Chen 's lab at Queen's College (CUNY) to work on topological data analaysis 2018/01/07 Projects Terrain Modeling Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) and Digital Surface Models (DSMs), provide a detailed geometric representation of a terrain. Terrain analysis requires extracting succinct descriptors that can capture the broader, higher level structures of the terrain. In my research, I focus on the Forman gradient and discrete Morse complexes as abstract morphological descriptions of a terrain. By using the Forman gradient, we can efficiently compute critical points and integral lines used for creating morphological segmentations. I am particularly interested in developing scalable and efficient methods for triangulations and point data of big size. Current mesh data structures are not feasible for very large data especially if parallelize/distribute the computation is required. In my work, I am using the Morse complexes as an intermediate representation for such purposes. Highlights Computing a Forman gradient requires perturbing the input values so to remove "flat regions" from the input data (areas where vertices have all the same function value). By perturbing we also introduce noise that has to be treated with noise removal techniques. We defined the first method for 2D simplicial complexes (terrain data and 3D triangulated shapes) that does no require data perturbation. The Forman gradient can be easily computed in parallel by working in the neighborhood of each vertex of an input dataset. Simplifying the Forman gradient is a much harder task to be performed in parallel. By using the Stellar tree, a spatio-topological data structure developed by my colleague Riccardo Fellegara , we have defined the first efficient method for simplifying a Forman gradient by efficiently subdividing the dataset. Topology Based Visual analytics Topological Data Analysis relies on tools rooted in computational topology. Based on TDA many visualization tools have been developed for studying the shape of an object or the analyzing the evolution of scalar or vector-valued functions. I am focusing on studying efficient tools for data segmentation, based on persistent homology. The generality of topological tools makes them well suited for any data, either they are scalar fields, point data, multivariate data or vector fields. Recently I have worked on the first algorithm for computing a gradient-based representation on multivariate data. This is the first algorithm capable of extracting a discrete gradient field on real-world data. In my current research, I am studying the relationships between this new gradient based representation and its monodimensional counterpart trying to extend the usefulness of persistent homology to the multidimensional case (i.e., when multiple filtrations are provided). Highlights The use of topological methods in scalar field analysis has been widely explored, but in applications, it is easy to find data described not by a single scalar field, but by multiple scalar fields (also called multivariate data). The use of topology here is at an exploratory stage. In our work , we have defined the first algorithm for computing a discrete vector field on multivariate data. By using the gradient, we can extract visual representations for studying the correlation among the multiple functions. Morse-Smale (MS) complexes can be simplified by using an explicit approach, working on the graph representation of the MS complex, or by using an implicit method, which natively works on the Forman gradient. It has been shown that this approach may create topologically-inconsistent representations when operating in three or higher dimensions. We have proposed the first simplification approach that does not present this issue. We published two new survey papers, one focusing on topology-based visualization and the other on the use of Morse complexes for shape analysis and visualization. While representing Morse complexes on regular data (square and cubical grids) is relatively easy, doing that efficiently on simplicial complexes is a challenging task. We have defined the first compact data structure for representing a Forman gradient on a tetrahedral mesh, effectively. By using a primal/dual argument, we have introduced the first compact representation for a discrete Morse complex defined on a simplicial complex. High-dimensional data analysis While several data structures have been proposed in the literature for both cell and simplicial complexes very few of them scale when working in high dimensions. We are working on a new model for encoding a simplicial complex, that we call a Stellar decomposition. The objective is obtaining a compact representation which scales well with both the size and the dimension of the complex. We are developing dedicated versions of the Stellar decomposition to be included in distributed frameworks, such as Hadoop or Apache Spark. I think that being able to represent a simplicial complex efficiently will boost the efficiency in high-dimensional data analysis, which nowadays is mainly limited to the analysis of point clouds or graphs. By developing structures like the Stellar decomposition, my objective is twofold: (i) overcome the current limitations in representing simplicial complexes when working with big data (ii) improving the efficiency of extracting structural information of high-dimensional data Highlights We are overcoming the representation of a complex interconnected network as a graph by encoding the maximal cliques extracted from the same graph. The collection of maximal cliques forms a high dimensional simplicial complex that provides information about the shape, in a topological sense, of said graph. We are defining a dimension independent edge contraction operator and a new way to verify the link condition to reduce the size of a simplicial complex while preserving its homology. The dimension independent edge contraction has been adopted in an exploratory work for retrieving cycles and holes in the geolocalized social network. By simplifying the simplicial complex (obtained by computing the maximal cliques on the network), we can recover the missing relationships among actors participating in the network.

[1] [2] About me My primary research interests are in computer graphics, especially in animation and perception of virtual characters. Character animation techniques and algorithms . I am particularly interested in developing new animation techniques using motion capture, statistical properties and learning through databases. Perception of lifelike virtual humans . Humans are capable of successfully distinguishing between human and computer-generated motions, even if the differences are marginal. This skill makes it a challenge to produce convincing animations, especially for very realistic human-like virtual characters. I aim to determine which components of human motion are crucial to lifelike appearance and which errors diminish this realism. Hand and finger motions . Hand and finger motions are omnipresent in daily life. Nevertheless, virtual characters often lack convincing hand and finger motions. Capturing, analyzing, understanding, and automatically generating these subtle movements are topics I address in my research. I am also interested in virtual reality, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. I received my PhD in 2011 from the Graphics, Vision and Visualization Group at Trinity College Dublin , Ireland , advised by Carol O'Sullivan . I then spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon's Graphics Lab working with Alla Safonova and Jessica Hodgins .

In 2008 its authors introduced a new version of the language, Python 3.0, that was not backward compatible with Python 2, initiating a transitional phase for Python software developers. Method: We have developed a Python compliance analyser, PyComply, and have assembled a large corpus of Python applications. We use PyComply to measure and quantify the degree to which Python 3 features are being used, as well as the rate and context of their adoption.

faculty	MENU Research Teaching Publications CV Andrew Robb Research Teaching Publications CV About Me I am an assistant professor in the School of Computing at Clemson University . Prior to joining Clemson University, I earned my PhD in the Virtual Experience Research Group at the University of Florida . My research explores how the availability of consumer virtual reality will affect society, and seeks to ensure that this effect will be positive. Specific areas of interest include understanding how user behavior in VR changes as users gain experience with the technology (this research is funded by NSF CHS Small #1717937), how embodying avatars in video games can alter user behavior in the real world, and comparing how people play games in VR to more traditional gaming media. I am also interested in the experience of presence, particularly in developing improved measures of presence so as to better understand how variations in virtual reality technology and design affect the user experience. A third area of research considers perception in virtual reality and the real world (this research is in collaboration with Sabarish Babu and Chris Pagano). Information for Students I am currently recruiting students, particularly students with experience developing virtual reality applications in Unity 3D or Unreal, developing conversational agents, or automated machine translation. If youre interested in understanding how people use virtual reality, and in how virtual reality changes people, please email me and we can set up a meeting. I ask all students interested in working with me to complete a small test project that aligns with our shared research interests to help me gauge your skills and areas of expertise.

faculty	Top Research Talks Teaching Contact Anwitaman Datta I am an associate professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at NTU Singapore. I currently teach (parts of) an undergraduate course on Cryptography & Network Security, and one on Security Management, along with parts of a graduate level course on Distributed Systems. Research My research interests span the topics of large-scale resilient distributed systems, information security and applications of data analytics. Some of my distinctive and pioneering research contributions, which have preceded and influenced new lines of research in respective research communities include: (i) decentralized online social networks for privacy and censorship resistance, (ii) novel erasure codes tailor made for distributed storage systems --- self-repairing (locally repairable) erasure codes, erasure codes with elastic redundancy, and codes exploiting cross-version sparsity to efficiently store multiple versions of data, and (iii) the application of machine learning and stereotyping to computational trust. I have also contributed to well established research topics, spanning security and privacy, distributed data stores, collaborative systems, social network analysis and decision support applications. Most of my publications are listed at: DBLP | Google Scholar . Currently I work on the following topics: Coding for storage The aim of this line of work is to build reliable distributed data storage systems based on novel erasure codes - exploring both new erasure coding techniques as well as suitable storage systems designs. Security & Privacy The aim of this line of work is to facilitate hosted data services supporting collaborative applications, while achieving various desired security and privacy objectives. Social media analysis The aim of this line of work is to mine social networks/media in order to derive actionable intelligence for decision support. Selected talks A selection of my (mostly, somewhat non-technical, industry oriented) talks: Cybersecurity: Post Breach Bitcoin Forensics On Ransomware, Cyber-armies and Malicious AI Teaching Advanced Topics in Distributed Systems In this graduate level course (co-taught with colleagues), students learn some basic principles of distributed computing and systems, and some selected and advanced topics focusing on specific niche distributed systems. Specifically, I teach about RAID and (erasure coding based) RAIN storage and cloud scale file systems. My Teaching material: RAID & beyond , Cloud scale storage , Cryptocurrencies and blockchain An extended version of this course has also been delivered as part of GIAN at IIT Indore . Security Management This undergraduate course emphasizes the need for good (IT) security management. Its aims are to identify the problems associated with security management and conduct case studies to show various (major) organisations (should) solve these problems. The overall treatment of the topics in the course is to provide an introductory glimpse, exploring the breadth of security management - rather than to go in depth of any specific topic. My Teaching material: Introduction ( slides | lecture notes ), Information security governance & the law ( slides | lecture notes ), Risk analysis & assessments ( slides | lecture notes ), Contingency planning & management ( slides | lecture notes ). Exercise questions & answers ( #1 , #2 ). Cryptography This is an introductory course on Cryptography and Network Security. I teach the first half dedicated to an introduction of some basic concepts of cryptography - including symmetric (classical ciphers, DES, AES, modes of operation) and asymmetric key cryptography (RSA, ECC), and the necessary elementary concepts from number theory. My Teaching material: Lecture slides: Introductory concepts and classical ciphers , Number theory basics , Secret key cryptography , Public key cryptography . Interactive web demos for some (random and) basic concepts and algorithms essential to cryptography.

Speech Act Modeling of Written Asynchronous Conversations: A Neural CRF Approach Shafiq Joty, and Tasnim Mohiuddin. In Computational Linguistics (Special Issue on Language in Social Media, Exploiting discourse and other contextual information) : pages 859 - 894, 2018. PDF Abstract Speech Act Modeling of Written Asynchronous Conversations: A Neural CRF Approach Participants in asynchronous conversations (e.g., forums, emails) interact with each other at different times, performing certain communicative acts, called speech acts (e.g., question, request). In this article, we propose a hybrid approach to speech act recognition in asynchronous conversations. Our approach works in two main steps: a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) first encodes each sentence separately into a task-specific distributed representation, which is then used in a conditional random field (CRF) model to capture the conversational dependencies between sentences. The LSTM-RNN uses pretrained word embeddings learned from a large conversational corpus and is trained to classify sentences into speech act types. The CRF model can consider arbitrary graph structures to model conversational dependencies in an asynchronous conversation. In addition, to mitigate the problem of limited annotated data in the asynchronous domains, we adapt the LSTM-RNN model to learn from synchronous conversations (e.g., meetings) using domain adversarial training of neural networks. Empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our approach over existing ones: (i) LSTM-RNNs provide better task-specific representations, (ii) conversational word embeddings benefit the LSTM-RNNs more than the off-the-shelf ones, (iii) adversarial training gives better domain-invariant representations, and (iv) the global CRF model improves over local models.

In arXiv (* not peer reviewed) 2018. PDF Abstract Phrase-Based Attentions Most state-of-the-art neural machine translation systems, despite being different in architectural skeletons (e.g. recurrence, convolutional), share an indispensable feature: the Attention. However, most existing attention methods are token-based and ignore the importance of phrasal alignments, the key ingredient for the success of phrase-based statistical machine translation. In this paper, we propose novel phrase-based attention methods to model n-grams of tokens as attention entities. We incorporate our phrase-based attentions into the recently proposed Transformer network, and demonstrate that our approach yields improvements of 1.3 BLEU for English-to-German and 0.5 BLEU for German-to-English translation tasks on WMT newstest2014 using WMT'16 training data.

In this framework, lexical, syntactic and semantic information from the reference and the two hypotheses is embedded into compact distributed vector representations, and fed into a multi-layer neural network that models nonlinear interactions between each of the hypotheses and the reference, as well as between the two hypotheses. We experiment with the benchmark datasets from the \WMT\ Metrics shared task, on which we obtain the best results published so far, with the basic network configuration. We also perform a series of experiments to analyze and understand the contribution of the different components of the network. We evaluate variants and extensions, including fine-tuning of the semantic embeddings, and sentence-based representations modeled with convolutional and recurrent neural networks. In summary, the proposed framework is flexible and generalizable, allows for efficient learning and scoring, and provides an \MT\ evaluation metric that correlates with human judgments, and is on par with the state of the art.

In Computer Speech & Language (Special Issue on Deep Learning for Machine Translation) : pages 161-179, 2017. PDF Abstract Domain Adaptation Using Neural Network Joint Model We explore neural joint models for the task of domain adaptation in machine translation in two ways: (i) we apply state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques, such as mixture modelling and data selection using the recently proposed Neural Network Joint Model (NNJM) (Devlin et al., 2014); (ii) we propose two novel approaches to perform adaptation through instance weighting and weight readjustment in the NNJM framework. In our first approach, we propose a pair of models called Neural Domain Adaptation Models (NDAM) that minimizes the cross entropy by regularizing the loss function with respect to in-domain (and optionally to out-domain) model. In the second approach, we present a set of Neural Fusion Models (NFM) that combines the in- and the out-domain models by readjusting their parameters based on the in-domain data. We evaluated our models on the standard task of translating English-to-German and Arabic-to-English TED talks. The NDAM models achieved better perplexities and modest BLEU improvements compared to the baseline NNJM, trained either on in-domain or on a concatenation of in- and out-domain data. On the other hand, the NFM models obtained significant improvements of up to +0.9 and +0.7 BLEU points, respectively. We also demonstrate improvements over existing adaptation methods such as instance weighting, phrasetable fill-up, linear and log-linear interpolations.

In Computational Linguistics : pages 683-722, 2017. PDF Abstract Discourse Structure in Machine Translation Evaluation In this article, we explore the potential of using sentence-level discourse structure for machine translation evaluation. We first design discourse-aware similarity measures, which use all- subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, we show that a simple linear combination with these measures can help improve various existing machine translation evaluation metrics regarding correlation with human judgments both at the segment- and at the system-level. This suggests that discourse information is complementary to the information used by many of the existing evaluation metrics, and thus it could be taken into account when developing richer evaluation metrics, such as the WMT-14 winning combined metric DISCOTKparty. We also provide a detailed analysis of the relevance of various discourse elements and relations from the RST parse trees for machine translation evaluation. In particular, we show that (i) all aspects of the RST tree are relevant, (ii) nuclearity is more useful than relation type, and (iii) the similarity of the translation RST tree to the reference RST tree is positively correlated with translation quality.

In JMIR mHealth and uHealth (JMU) 2016. PDF Abstract Sleep Quality Prediction From Wearable Data Using Deep Learning BACKGROUND: The importance of sleep is paramount to health. Insufficient sleep can reduce physical, emotional, and mental well-being and can lead to a multitude of health complications among people with chronic conditions. Physical activity and sleep are highly interrelated health behaviors. Our physical activity during the day (ie, awake time) influences our quality of sleep, and vice versa. The current popularity of wearables for tracking physical activity and sleep, including actigraphy devices, can foster the development of new advanced data analytics. This can help to develop new electronic health (eHealth) applications and provide more insights into sleep science. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of predicting sleep quality (ie, poor or adequate sleep efficiency) given the physical activity wearable data during awake time. In this study, we focused on predicting good or poor sleep efficiency as an indicator of sleep quality. METHODS: Actigraphy sensors are wearable medical devices used to study sleep and physical activity patterns. The dataset used in our experiments contained the complete actigraphy data from a subset of 92 adolescents over 1 full week. Physical activity data during awake time was used to create predictive models for sleep quality, in particular, poor or good sleep efficiency. The physical activity data from sleep time was used for the evaluation. We compared the predictive performance of traditional logistic regression with more advanced deep learning methods: multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), simple Elman-type recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM-RNN), and a time-batched version of LSTM-RNN (TB-LSTM). RESULTS: Deep learning models were able to predict the quality of sleep (ie, poor or good sleep efficiency) based on wearable data from awake periods. More specifically, the deep learning methods performed better than traditional logistic regression. CNN had the highest specificity and sensitivity, and an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.9449, which was 46% better as compared with traditional logistic regression (0.6463). CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning methods can predict the quality of sleep based on actigraphy data from awake periods. These predictive models can be an important tool for sleep research and to improve eHealth solutions for sleep.

In Computational Linguistics : pages 385-435, 2015. PDF Abstract CODRA: A Novel Discriminative Framework for Rhetorical Analysis Clauses and sentences rarely stand on their own in an actual discourse; rather, the relationship between them carries important information that allows the discourse to express a meaning as a whole beyond the sum of its individual parts. Rhetorical analysis seeks to uncover this coherence structure. In this article, we present CODRA a COmplete probabilistic Discriminative framework for performing Rhetorical Analysis in accordance with Rhetorical Structure Theory, which posits a tree representation of a discourse. CODRA comprises a discourse segmenter and a discourse parser. First, the discourse segmenter, which is based on a binary classifier, identifies the elementary discourse units in a given text. Then the discourse parser builds a discourse tree by applying an optimal parsing algorithm to probabilities inferred from two Conditional Random Fields: one for intra-sentential parsing and the other for multi-sentential parsing. We present two approaches to combine these two stages of parsing effectively. By conducting a series of empirical evaluations over two different data sets, we demonstrate that CODRA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, often by a wide margin. We also show that a reranking of the k-best parse hypotheses generated by CODRA can potentially improve the accuracy even further.

In Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research : pages 521-573, 2013. PDF Abstract Topic Segmentation and Labeling in Asynchronous Conversations Topic segmentation and labeling is often considered a prerequisite for higher-level conversation analysis and has been shown to be useful in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. We present two new corpora of email and blog conversations annotated with topics, and evaluate annotator reliability for the segmentation and labeling tasks in these asynchronous conversations. We propose a complete computational framework for topic segmentation and labeling in asynchronous conversations. Our approach extends state-of-the-art methods by considering a fine-grained structure of an asynchronous conversation, along with other conversational features by applying recent graph-based methods for NLP. For topic segmentation, we propose two novel unsupervised models that exploit the fine-grained conversational structure, and a novel graph-theoretic supervised model that combines lexical, conversational and topic features. For topic labeling, we propose two novel (unsupervised) random walk models that respectively capture conversation specific clues from two different sources: the leading sentences and the fine-grained conversational structure. Empirical evaluation shows that the segmentation and the labeling performed by our best models beat the state-of-the-art, and are highly correlated with human annotations.

In Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research : pages 1-47, 2009. PDF Abstract Complex Question Answering: Unsupervised Learning Approaches and Experiments Complex questions that require inferencing and synthesizing information from multiple documents can be seen as a kind of topic-oriented, informative multi-document summarization where the goal is to produce a single text as a compressed version of a set of documents with a minimum loss of relevant information. In this paper, we experiment with one empirical method and two unsupervised statistical machine learning techniques: K-means and Expectation Maximization (EM), for computing relative importance of the sentences. We compare the results of these approaches. Our experiments show that the empirical approach outperforms the other two techniques and EM performs better than K-means. However, the performance of these approaches depends entirely on the feature set used and the weighting of these features. In order to measure the importance and relevance to the user query we extract different kinds of features (i.e. lexical, lexical semantic, cosine similarity, basic element, tree kernel based syntactic and shallow-semantic) for each of the document sentences. We use a local search technique to learn the weights of the features. To the best of our knowledge, no study has used tree kernel functions to encode syntactic/semantic information for more complex tasks such as computing the relatedness between the query sentences and the document sentences in order to generate query-focused summaries (or answers to complex questions). For each of our methods of generating summaries (i.e. empirical, K-means and EM) we show the effects of syntactic and shallow-semantic features over the bag-of-words (BOW) features.

RESEARCH EXPERTISE My main interests lie in our desire to making sense of big heterogeneous data for real application in engineering, life science, and medical. Data Science (Bioinformatics) Research High throughput biological measurements and experiments in life science and healthcare have resulted in the explosion of data available from sequencing and micro-arrays, ChIP-Microarrays (ChIP-chip). This has led to the interdisciplinary science called Bioinformatics. Which use Data Science in solving biological and life science problems. Machine Learning and Statistical Inference Machine Learning and statistical modelling techniques that can learn from data to enables the making of the decision and simply a classification , this has application in almost every area. There are many approaches and each has its own merits. The following have been heavily used in my group: support vector machines, decision tree learning, artificial neural networks, Bayesian networks, genetic and mimetic algorithms. Example include application in supertype -specific HLA Class I binding peptides, protein-ligand binding affinity. Learning with Unlabeled Data In the context of machine learning, PU learning is a collection of semi-supervised techniques for training binary classifiers on positive (P) and unlabeled (U) examples. To improve performance, it is important to partition U into four sets, namely, reliable negative set RN, likely positive set LP, likely negative set LN, and weak negative set WN. Such an approach has been used to identifying disease genes from the human genome is an important but challenging task in biomedical research. Meta and Ensemble learning Meta-learning is where automatic learning algorithms are applied to meta-data about machine learning experiments. The main goal is to use meta-data to understand how automatic learning can become flexible in solving different kinds of learning problems and enrich the knowledge discovered. Coupled with ensemble methods that that integrates results of multiple predictive methods into one system, these approach has found to be instrumental in improving predictive performance. Application of this approach has been widely used in big data such as bioinformatics and medical informatics. An example includes multiple kernel learning for heterogeneous data fusion and s parse learning in genome-wide association study (GWAS ) , and drug-target interaction prediction. Ontology for Knowledge Representation Ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. There have been major initiatives in medical and bioinformatics to standardize the representation of terminology and relationship across diseases, species and databases. The controlled vocabulary of terms and description of product characteristics are the main outcome to improve annotation for representation of meta-concept that greatly enhances analysis. Specifically, it has been extensively applied in complex mining, inferring gene-disease-phenotype association. Computational Structural Biology This is where Computational Science and Engineering finds its applications in understanding the molecular structure of biological macromolecules. Dealing with computational models and simulations, the field makes use of high-performance computing to solve complex and expensive problems in biology. The result includes the acceleration of docking and its application in the understanding of influenza and other viruses. SOFTWARE CovalentDock Cloud: a web server for automated covalent docking Covalent binding is an important mechanism for many drugs to gain its function. We developed a computational algorithm to model this chemical event and extended it to a web server, the CovalentDock Cloud, to make it accessible directly online without any local installation and configuration. It provides a simple yet user-friendly web interface to perform covalent docking experiments and analysis online. Software for Accelerating Autodock Vina Quickvina : This project aims at accelerating Autodock Vina , a program for protein-ligand docking. The main idea is to skip some of the local searches which are not promising in finding a better solution. Quick Vina 2 is a fast and accurate molecular docking tool, attained at accurately accelerating AutoDock Vina .

A few words about myself... I received a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and then a Master's degree in Digital Signal Processing from Sun Yat-Sen (Zhongshan) University, Guangzhou, China. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Vision from Kings College, London University, UK. I taught and researched in Sun Yat-Sen University, Shantou University (China), Bath University (UK), National University of Singapore, Institute of Microelectronics (Singapore), and Institute for Infocomm Research (Singapore). In February 2007, I joined the faculty of Nanyang Technological University. I am aFellow of IEEE, a Fellow of IET, a Chartered Engineer, and Honorary Fellow of SIET. My additional duties include serving as an Associate Editor for IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, and IEEE Trans. Circuits and Systems for Video Technology. My research deals with image processing, perception-based modeling, video compression, and multimedia communication. I believe that good theory is practical and effective teamwork can achieve the goal of "1+1>2"; I have kept a balance of academic research and industrial deployment (and even some business development) in my working life, and also managed over ten successfully-delivered major projects for external customers. It has been my good fortune to have the chances to work with many colleagues and students in various organizations. I always look forward to collaborating with more researchers who think alike, and am eager to meet new students with an interest in image processing, communication and understanding, as well as modeling the relevant physiological and psychological findings. My Final Year Project student, Lim Yuan Jun, developed an interesting demo: Perceptual Characteristics & Phenomena Gallery . We have also built a RetargetedImage Subjective Quality Database and a database for Perceptual Quality Assessment of Screen Content Images (SIQAD). Some related research can be seen here . At leisure, I like reading and taking walks. The books I like include: The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, by Stephen R. Covey; Fishing Lessons-Insights, Fun, and Philosophy from a Passionate Angler, by Paul Quinnett ; A Brief History of Time, by Stephen Hawking; Bounce: Mozart, Federer, Picasso, Beckham, and the Science of Success, by Matthew Syed; The Happy Student: 5 Steps to Academic Fulfillment and Success, by Daniel Wong; LETTERS TO HIS SON , by the EARL OF CHESTERFIELD; Tan Swie Hian Fables; Teacher Man, by Frank McCourt; Tuesdays with Morrie, by Mitch Albom.

Research Interests The focus of my research has been on innovative disruptive AI approaches and methods that synergize human intelligence, artificial intelligence and behaviour data analytics, namely human enriched AI . Results from my basic research have been used in important application areas such as technologies for ageless aging, healthy living and innovative learning . Research Statement I am working on new disruptive Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches that synergize human intelligence, artificial intelligence and behavior data analytics (AI powered by humans). AI powered by humans Artificial intelligence (AI) as a field has recently undergone a dramatic shift from trying to build intelligent machines towards harnessing the power of human computation to tackle problems that cannot be solved by computers alone. A notable example of such approaches is Gmails reCAPTCHA system which asks users to recognize alphanumeric characters written in non-standard fonts and styles. Since this task is easy for humans but very challenging for machines, it provides an elegant way for distinguishing between machines and humans as well as engaging the assistance of humans for digitizing old manuscripts. I have pioneered a new research field in AI for crowdsourcing Algorithmic Crowdsourcing for efficient mass mobilization to help with computational tasks that are too challenging for todays computing machines. I have proposed a series of real-time algorithms for efficient large-scale social engagement by combining game theory with network queuing theory. I have proposed new models in Personal AI to endow traditional intelligent software agents with human traits such as teachability, persuasion, trust and curiosity. My work on new disruptive AI e.g. Crowd AI and Personal AI has garnered awards at the top AI conferences IJCAI, AAAI, AAMAS & IAT. An example (Personal AI) application deriving from my research is the use of a digital form of the well-known Trail Making Test (TMT) for stroke detection. A traditional TMT, conducted using paper and pencil, requires the assistance of medical professionals. This limits its use by a large population of users for screening purposes. Through user-friendly TMT-based games running on smart phones and pads, it becomes feasible to collect health data from millions of users. From the data, user behavior patterns can be analyzed by using AI methods, enhanced by human experts (AI powered by humans) when needed. This work has been accepted for publication in the journal Science . A second example (Crowd AI) application of my research which was reported in the Feb 10, 2016 edition of the New Scientist ( https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076775-our-photo-uploads-give-scientists-billions-of-eyes-on-the-world/ ) is AirTick , a smart phone App which uses a combination of crowdsourcing and machine learning to estimate pollution levels based on pictures taken by the phone. AirTick allows anyone with a smart phone to get real-time estimates of the ambient air quality. Reports gathered from many individuals at many different locations provide a rich source of data which can be analyzed to implement cost-effective measures for combatting air pollution. Professor Thomas Dietterich, President of TheAssociation for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence(AAAI) commented on my research work at AAAI 2016: Prof Miaos research in humanized AI imparting human qualities such as trust, curiosity and persuasion into intelligent agents could help establish more healthy relationships between humans and AI. He further commented that Crowd AI research led by Prof Miao at LIlY is very novel. Her work in applying AI technologies to solve population aging challenges is the only work of its kind that I know of. Our methods have been used by top tech companies such as Apple (Research Kit), Baidu (Crowdsourcing platform), Taobao (recommendation), health care organizations such as TTS hospital and Pacific Parkinson research centre and numerous elderly communities. In the last 5 years, I have added to NTUs research profile with over 120 peer-reviewed research publications, including 33 journal papers, 91 conference papers, 2 book chapters, 1 edited book and 13 technology disclosure/patents filed. My current research works have received a total citation count (H-index) of 2827 (28) on Google Scholar, 1241 (17) on Scopus, and 1560 (19) on Web of Science. Over these years, I am honoured to have been invited by international colleagues as keynote speaker and invited speaker at international conferences and workshops, and at international research institutions, universities and multi-national companies, to discuss the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence, Human Computation, Data Analytics and Digital Media for 27 times in total. Impactful examples of my research which exploit the combined power of AI, human wisdom and data analytics include: 1) Virtual Singapura which provides an agent augmented immersive learning environment to support active learning for a large number of learners through online learning behavior trajectory big data analytics. Virtual Singapura is being used by high schools in several countries. 2) Intelligent Ageing in Place platforms with unobtrusive sensing and multidimensional behavior data analytics for assessing the wellness of the occupant(s), and novel personal AI digital assistants for active independent living and a dignified lifestyle. 3) Age-friendly AI empowered games for health and wellness, e.g. screening and rehabilitation games for stroke and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinsons and dementia. In these games, data are continuously collected and analyzed to provide health professionals with insights into the conditions of their patients. My paper Using motor patterns for stroke detection has been accepted for publication by Science . My interactive digital games for screening for strokes and Parkinsons disease will be made available to more than 800 million Apple users around the world through the Apple Research Kit. This will enable a massive scale study on the behaviour trajectory and patterns of stroke and Parkinsons patients. I have published over 200 papers in top-tier international AI conferences and ACM/IEEE journals, and am one of top cited researchers in Cognitive Map theory, Human Agent Interaction and Algorithmic Crowdsourcing.
faculty	Home Data Security / Blockchain Privacy Protection Machine Learning / AI Contact Me Hi, welcome to my site. About Me, Briefly Dr. W. K. NG works in machine learning, privacy-preserving techniques, query-permissible encrypted databases, enterprise blockchain systems, data security, and blockchain security. His work is motivated by the need to harness the power of data for the betterment of stakeholders, where the data has confidentiality and privacy issues; where the data may be owned and held by different stakeholders, and where the data is so large that it must be hosted in cloud servers that are never completely secured (susceptible to insider and cyber attacks). He contributes to companies and industries as technology consultant on projects involving data analytics, artificial intelligence, data privacy and security, and blockchain. In recent years, his involvement in conferences and workshop can be found here . His work is supported by various research grants, which can be found here . He is Associate Editor and Member of Editorial Boards of five journals. Over the years, he has worked with many talented students on their PhD and Master theses. Dr. Ng writes for online magazines and newspapers and contributes to social causes. "A man's character may be learned from the adjectives which he habitually uses in conversation." - Mark Twain Current Research and Industry-inspired Projects Enterprise Blockchain Systems : Current blockchain systems are not built for enterprise use. Reasons are poor performance, security and vulnerability issues, and the lack of facilities to support enterprise data processing, data analysis and reporting, and data compliance needs. This research looks into the fundamental re-design of blockchain for high transaction throughput, confidentiality and privacy guarantees, the structure of multi-chains, fast consensus algorithms, block compression and archival, blockchain migration, multi-chain connectors, etc. to address enterprise needs for blockchains. We investigate hybrid blockchains - public-private mix of ownership, token and token-less mix of blockchain operations, etc. To support data privacy and advanced data needs, we study the integration of secure multiparty computation with blockchain. Blockchain-based Data Protection Platform for Digital Manufacturing Services : We build one of the the worlds first Digital Manufacturing Services (DMS) platform based on Blockchain technology to create digital thread for data protection. As blockchain technology enables transparency in all processes, it will drive the desired behaviour of all parties in the value chain. The data protection framework prevents data theft and data tampering in the 3D printing process. The framework connects designers to Additive Manufacturing Centres (AMC) to simplify the 3D product manufacturing process; secures designers data and ensures high quality output. Users are able to place order for 3D printing of parts anytime, anywhere through this framework. This is attractive to large companies managing 10,000s of SKUs and complex global supply chains who want to deploy 3DP, but many not have the infrastructure. We hope to fill the gaps in the 3D printing industry to accelerate industry adoption, making 3D Printing as simple as printing a document from a desktop computer. Privacy Preserving Data Analytics : To realize the full potential of a smart city, one must harness the massive volume of data that have been (and are still being) generated and accumulated in all work and living aspects of the city. A major obstacle in this regard is data privacy; the need to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This research create techniques and systems to address data privacy issues: (1) The need to aggregate data about people from multiple public/private sources for collective data analysis or the application of artificial intelligence techniques without violating privacy; (2) The need to analyze different types of data: numerals, texts, documents, images, etc., which contain sensitive or personal information; (3) The need to understand and manage the data leakage risk of aggregating and analyzing personal data. Deep Learning/Machine Learning Approach to Threat Alert Triage and Risk Modeling There are many indicators of threat in Know-Your-Clients (KYC) processing, from information systems in use to surveillance inputs to open source intelligence to threat typologies. We want to determine the probability of threat (dependent variable) with respect to the linear or non-linear relationships with the many diverse predictor variables (independent variables). This must be done in a real-time continuous manner as KYC is dynamic, including multi-hypothesis tracking. The nature of the relationship among the variables might change with the progression of the time and new types of variables can come into existence that may be proved useful for better prediction accuracy. We use DL/ML approaches to assist financial institutions in triaging KYC threat alerts (with probability and explainable typologies) and to assess risks. With sufficient data, we are can infer new indicators of threats and new typologies. Computational Air Mobility : The desire to have air mobility creates a host of computational problems. What is the revenue model for infrastructural air mobility? What is the trade-off between utility provision and safety? What is the relationship between the mobility structure and routing algorithms? For fleet owners, how many aerial vehicles should they own to sustain a profitable operation? What is the pros and cons of having fixed flight schedules versus free flight? We formulate each of these issues as an optimization or constraint satisfaction problem and investigate solution techniques to solve the problems. We also build a multi-agent modeling and simulation system to support empirical investigations.

Research Interests His main interests includes the research and study of brain-inspired functional and computational models of memory structures that underlie the human reasoning process. In addition, advanced brain-inspired reasoning and cognition frameworks such as focus of attention, affect modeling, skill learning from novice to expert are actively investigated using the neurocognitive informatic approach. Fuzzy, Fuzzy neural, Neural, GA, GA-Neural, Rough set that maps formal fuzzy logical structures onto neural systems to perform fuzzy set derivation and Rule identification/reduction are investigated. The development of architectures that supports on-line and off-line learning fuzzy intelligent rule based systems is examined. The research issues cover fuzzy clustering, learning, modeling, fuzzy rule model, etc. These basic techniques are used to craft the brain-inspired memory learning systems. These memory learning structures are the building blocks of the functional neuro-cognitive brain and they can be broadly classified into huppocampal global semantic memories and neocortical like semantic association memories. In addition, research into CMAC and in-house developed MCMACs and Fuzzy MCMACs are actively pursued. They form a class of cerebellar like association memories that have excellent memory resolution and recall. The application areas are extensive as they rely heavily on the basic research into brain-inspired learning memory structures and brain-inspired cognitive architectures for emotion, cognition and perception modeling. The exciting application areas include computational finance ? arbitration, portfolio, trend analysis, bond and commodity trading; biomedical engineering ? diabetes modeling and control, ICU ventilator control; Affect modeling for edutainment, forensic tools, marketing research tools; Medical decision support tools ? thermograph analysis, pediatric leukemia and ovarian cancer analysis; Intelligent transportation analysis tools ? trend analysis and incident monitoring; as well as student affect modeling in Intelligent Tutoring System.

In particular, I have studied methods to leverage low-dimensional models in a variety of contexts, including when data are high-dimensional, contain missing entries, are subject to constrained sensing or communication resources, correspond to point processes, or arise in ill-conditioned inverse problems. This work lies at the intersection of high-dimensional statistics, inverse problems in imaging and network science (including compressed sensing), learning theory, algebraic geometry, optical engineering, nonlinear approximation theory, statistical signal processing, and optimization theory. My group has made contributions both in the mathematical foundations of signal processing and machine learning and in their application to a variety of real-world problems. I have active collaborations with researchers in astronomy, materials science, microscopy, electronic health record analysis, cognitive neuroscience, precision agriculture, biochemistry, and atmospheric science.

Goldsmith           Edward Carson Waller Distinguished Service Professor of Linguistics and Computer Science        Battle in the Mind Fields  Battle in the Mind Fields is the title of a book that I recently finished, with Bernard Laks,  which reflects on the nature of intellectual  rupture and continuity, with a careful look at linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and logic during the period from 1870 to 1940. Here is a  link to the book\'s webpage, and here is a link to the genealogical skein  which you see just below. It will appear in early 2018 with the University of Chicago Press.    Linguistica  Linguistica is the name of a family of programs that I and students of mine have developed to learn the morphology of natural languages.  Its goal is to help us understand what kind of prior knowledge would be important, useful, and necessary in order to learn the morphology of natural languages.

Specific interests include:    achieving a better understanding of the limits of powerful algorithmic paradigms for solving NP-hard problems, such as kernelization (efficient preprocessing of the input) and intelligent random guessing to obtain solutions;  the study of non-standard proof systems, which incorporate features like interaction with provers, probabilistic verification, and the manipulation of quantum states;  prospects and limits to efficient joint computation, in cases where  we have multiple computational tasks to perform simultaneously, and where we may hope cleverly combine computations to make them more efficient and reliable.  Outside of complexity theory, I\'ve worked on problems in prediction and polynomial approximation.  I also have a personal interest in using algorithmic ideas to better understand the power of human memory.

Science pairs measurement tools that produce experimental data with computational tools to process the data. Advances in scanned imaging modalities (like MRI and confocal microscopy) are constantly increasing the speed, resolution, and sophistication of image measurements. Scientists can now form hypotheses and conduct experiments faster than they can find or create the computational analysis best matched to their new image data. Unfortunately, the process of creating new software remains slow or opaque for many people, and advances in parallel computing (required for large images) complicate the process even for experts. I collaborate with physical and biomedical researchers who acquire image data to answer scientific questions. My research simplifies how informative visualizations are created, and improves how relevant image features are detected, sampled, and quantified. I am also interested in the theoretical and perceptual bases of effective data visualization. I foster re-usable and reproducible computational science by making all my research software open-source. I look for computer science students who, like me, are excited by the prospect of accelerating science with better computing.  See my information about applying.

This creates a great\r burden on programmers who must be experts in both their application\r domain and in the myriad system issues that affect power, energy,\r reliability, performance, and more. To alleviate this burden, I study\r ways to build  self-aware computing systems  that understand\r high-level goals and automatically adapt their behavior to meet those\r goals optimally. This is interdisciplinary work covering traditional\r areas, like operating systems and computer architecture, as well as\r new areas, like control theory and machine learning applied to\r computer system management and optimization.\r \r \r Project Web Pages:  CERES , SEEC, POET, LEO\r \r Current Students: \r Saeid Barati, \r G\xf6kalp Demirci,\r Bernard Dickens,\r Anne Farrel,\r Will Kong,\r Ivana Marincic,\r Ahsan Pervaiz,\r Muhammad Husni Santriaji,\r Yuliana Zamora,\r  Huazhe (Harper) Zhang \r \r Alumni:\r Zhixuan Zhou, PhD 2018 [thesis] , Google \r Connor Imes, PhD, 2018 [thesis] , ISI East \r Nikita Mishra, PhD 2017  [thesis], Solvvy \r Lee Ehudin, BS/MS 2017, Google \r Tristan Rasmussen, BS/MS 2015, Google\r \r \r Old Research Statement (from 2015): [pdf] \r \r \r \r \r \r \r News\r \r  Our CALOREE paper from ASPLOS 2018 was selected as an IEEE Micro Top Picks Honorable Mention.

[article]  \r  We recently published two papers with exponential improvements on the worst case approximation for scheduling under performance and power constraints.  The first (at STACS 2018) improved the known bound from O(n) to O(log n). The second (at Supercomputing 2018) made this algorithm practical by accounting for configurable power/performance tradeoffs. To the best of our knowledge these are the first practical scheduling algorithms that use something other than greedy approaches. \r   Bernard Dickens III has received a Generation Google Scholarship.

Saks-K. Hildrum-B. Y. Zhao)           This page, circa 2011          I am Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at University of Chicago.      My research covers a range of topics from large-distributed     networks and systems, HCI, security and     privacy, and wireless / mobile systems, mostly from a data-driven perspective.  My current projects     are focused on three areas: data-driven models of user behavior/interactions,      security of online and mobile communities, and     wireless systems and protocols. My work targets a range of top      conferences, including WWW/IMC, UsenixSecurity/NDSS/S&P/CCS, CHI/CSCW, and Mobicom/SIGCOMM/NSDI. Here\'s a wordle of my     paper abstracts from 2017-2018.        Together with Prof. Heather Zheng, I co-direct the SAND      Lab (Systems, Algorithms, Networking and Data) at University of Chicago. I received my PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2004, where I was advised by         John Kubiatowicz          and Anthony Joseph, and created the Tapestry distributed hash table (dissertation). I received my MS from Berkeley in 2000, and my BS in computer science from Yale in 1997.

Data scientists spend many hours manipulating and cleaning data, writing careful/scalable data analysis programs, and debugging analyses. My group explores the intersection of AI and Data Sciencetowards a world where intelligent systems can automatically perform many of the data analytics tasks we currently expect humans to do. News/Updates 1/23/19 New paper on Band-limited Convolutions for adaptive resource control during model training. Stay tuned for a preprint! 1/13/19 Going to CIDR, will present a new paper on visual data management. https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07607 1/09/19 Blog post! https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/what-is-the-role-of-machine-learning-in-databases/?twitter=@bigdata 12/15/18 NeurIPS Invited Workshop Talk:  http://mlforsystems.org/ Current Projects We are always looking for exceptional undergraduates, graduate students, and post-docs! Email me. skr @ cs . uchicago Deep Query Optimization. What is the role of machine learning in the design and implementation of a modern database system? This question has sparked considerable introspectionin the data management community, and the epicenter of this debate is the core database problem of query optimization, where the database system finds the best physical execution path for an SQL query. Read our recent research paper on this. A Formal Theory of Data Science: Datasets often undergo a sequence of rule-based transformations before they are used in any data analytics. Many data scientists craft these rules by hand after observing representative samples of data. However, as with any type of decision rules, the chosen transformations might be overly specific to those errors manifest in the sample, or conversely, may have unforeseen side-effects on unseen data.We seek to formalize this process and understand when data transformation scripts can be expected to generalize. DeepLens, A Visual Data Management System: New results in deep learning give us tools to add structure to natural data like images and video. We explore using these tools to answer semantic queries on image and video. Read our paper published at CIDR 19. Optimizing Machine Learning Programs.TrainingMachineLearningmodels at scale is a core application for many distributed systems. We explore adaptive optimization, auto-scaling, and model compression.L Publications How do we build systems that continuously learn from real-world interactions?

I founded the UChicago SUPERgroup, an interdisciplinary research collective with dozens of members. Our research spans computer security, privacy, and human-computer interaction (HCI). We are especially interested in using data-driven methods to help users make better security and privacy decisions, as well as to make complex computer systems more usable for non-technical users. Our work has been supported by four NSF grants, as well as grants from Mozilla Research and the Data Transparency Lab. My dissertation focused on supporting users\' password-security decisions with data. I have also worked extensively on supporting users\' online privacy and on the Internet of Things (IoT). I received my PhD in 2016 from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Lorrie Cranor. I have been fortunate to receive three best paper awards (CHI 2017, USENIX Security 2016, & UbiComp 2014), the 2018 SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award, the 2018 IEEE Cybersecurity Award for Practice (jointly with other members of the CMU passwords group), the 2016 John Karat Usable Privacy and Security Student Research Award, an NDSEG fellowship, a Fulbright scholarship, and two honorable mentions for best paper (CHI 2016 & CHI 2012). I value transferring research to practice, such as through the Bank Privacy website and Password Guessability Service. I have strong interests in teaching and K-12 outreach, particularly for broadening participation in CS. I earned my AB in computer science from Harvard University and worked for three years at Rutgers University on outreach and diversity programs. My first name is pronounced "blaze," and my full name is pronounced "blazer." I prefer to be called Blase rather than Professor Ur or Dr. Ur, both of which sound ridiculous. (Note, just Blase, not Professor Blase or Dr. Blase). I am also a musician and photographer, and previously a theatre designer. I ride my bicycle (almost) everywhere, collect records, travel, and drink too much coffee. I\'m from somewhere in the swamps of New Jersey.

Recently (and reluctantly) added buzzwords: Big Data, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence Older buzzwords that are trendy now: Machine Learning Not so old buzzwords that are not trendy now: Data Mining I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in using computation, data and analytics for solving high impact social good problems in areas such as criminal justice, education, healthcare, energy, transportation, economic development, and public safety. I am the Director of the Center for Data Science and Public Policy, \xc2\xa0Research Director and Senior Fellow at the\xc2\xa0Computation Institute and a Senior Fellow at the\xc2\xa0Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago. What I used to do: Chief Scientist at Obama for America 2012 campaign focusing on analytics, technology, and data. Senior Research Scientist and Director of Analytics research at Accenture Labs where I led a technology research team focused on applied R&D in analytics, machine learning, and data mining for large-scale & emerging business problems in various industries including healthcare, retail & CPG, manufacturing, intelligence, and financial services. In my ample free time, I advise several analytics start-ups and non-profits, speak at, organize and participate in academic and industry analytics conferences, and publish in machine learning and data mining conferences and journals. [Longer CV] Research Interests:Historically, my research\xc2\xa0has spanned from general machine learning and data science to privacy preserving data analysis, text analysis, semi-supervised learning, active learning, information retrieval, Natural Language Processing, and knowledge management. Most of my work has focused on developing and using machine learning & data mining approaches to solve large-scale problems in corporate, political, and non-profit areas. My current interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Public Policy, and Social Sciences. I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in solving large-scale and high impact social problems using data driven and evidence based methods. A lot of government, civic, and non-profit organizations are realizing the value of better data and have been focusing on improving data collection and data standardization. My goal is to build on these efforts, and work with these organizations to use this data to help improve outcomes. My work involves developing and using machine learning and social science methods that can be operationalized to solve policy and social challenges across health, criminal justice, education, public safety, criminal justice, social services, and economic development. My work has three areas of focus: Training: students and professionals in governments and non profits in the use of data driven methods (Machine Learning, AI, Data Science) for policy and social good Collaborative Projects: with governments and non profits to solve problems in policy and social good R&D: to develop new methods that are needed across policy areas with special emphasis on increasing fairness, reducing bias, making machine learning and AI algorithms and models more understandable and transparent. Current Projects:My current projects include: Training Data Science for Social Good Fellowship Developing and teaching a training program in\xc2\xa0Applied Data Analytics for Public Policy for government agencies, foundations and non-profits. Projects working with police departments to build Early Intervention Systems that can help identify officers (and dispatches) at risk of adverse interactions with the public working with public health departments to do preventative lead inspections and reduce lead poisoning in children working with cities to improve home\xc2\xa0inspection processes to for early blight detection (and prevention) and/or to improve code compliance and health and safety violations in rental properties. working with jurisdictions to combine criminal justice, homelessness, mental health, and medical data to identify people in need of social services and public assistance programs and prevent future incarceration working with school districts to identify students in need of extra support to achieve different educational outcomes (high school graduation for example) Research comparing existing and developing new methods to make machine learning ad artificial intelligence methods and models more understandable and interpretable for use in policy problems. developing bias and fairness audit tools for machine learning models (See Aequitas, our new Bias and Fairness Auidit Tool) conducting a bias and fairness analysis across problems in education, health, criminal justice, and social services.

Assistant Clinical Professor, Masters Program in Computer Science Scientist, Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases, Argonne National Laboratory Senior Fellow, Computation Institute, The University of Chicago CONTACT INFORMATION Email:\xc2\xa0abinkowski@uchicago.edu BIOGRAPHY Andrew is a Fellow at the Computation Institute of Chicago and a scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. \xc2\xa0His research is focused on developing new techniques for computer-aided drug discovery and applying them to study targeted proteins from human pathogens causing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.\xc2\xa0 He conducts large-scale computing simulation experiments on one of the world\'s largest supercomputers at Argonne and, ironically, teaches on the world\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful computer you can fit in your pocket, the iPhone. MASTERS PROGRAM IN COMPUTER SCIENCE Andrew teaches\xc2\xa0Mobile Application Development, focusing on iOS technologies. \xc2\xa0 Andrew is proud to be part of the Masters Program in Computer Science faculty as he believes UChicago constantly examines the curriculum to provide courses that meet the needs of employers to adequately prepare students for the workplace, in addition to educating on cutting-edge technologies and topic areas as fast as they come to market. TEACHING PHILOSOPHY Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s teaching philosophy is to provide the tools to enable students to be independent learners. Knowing that computer science is a rapidly evolving field, he believes that to keep pace, students will have to be able to continue learning well after they have left the classroom. \xc2\xa0They will not be able to rely strictly on what they were taught in class to have successful and productive careers.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 His goal is to teach a strong foundation of understanding for programming concepts that will be applicable to a broad range of problems, and then to provide practical instruction to solving them. \xe2\x80\x9cI focus on practical approaches to solving problems that can be accomplished using a variety of approaches. \xc2\xa0While I currently teach one specific programming language, I aim to have the concepts be applicable to any platform or language.The academic standard and rigors that are associated with University of Chicago graduate degree are immediately recognized and respected by employers and colleagues. \xc2\xa0However, the strength of the Masters Program in Computer Science lies with the instructors, who come from a combination of academia, government and commercial backgrounds. \xc2\xa0The collective expertise of the faculty is tremendous and provides a breadth of course variety that is unparalleled.\xe2\x80\x9d PUBLISHED STUDIES, RESEARCH, ETC Andrew has been developing applications for the Macintosh platform for over 15 years and for iOS since its inception.\xc2\xa0 He has developed and consulted on over 20 applications currently available in the App Store, several of which have been featured by Apple, including selections on the front page of the App Store.\xc2\xa0 He is active in the development of standards and safeguards in educational software and has represented the interests on independent educational software developers in Washington D.C.

faculty	Adam Shaw @ The University of Chicago document.write(banner()); Surfers of the web: welcome! As of December 2012, I am a Senior Lecturer in the  Department of Computer Science at the  University of Chicago. Computer science minors, please scroll down the page a bit. There are many Adam Shaws on the web; I\'m the real one.  More specifically, I am the one born at the (now shuttered) Mt. Sinai Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio in 1972 (when David Gilmour, and countless others, looked essentially  like this) and who grew up in North Branford, Connecticut. I started programming BASIC on an Apple ][+ my parents bought around 1980, when I was 8years old or thereabouts. I wrote programs on that machine to do things like print my name 10times, then 50times, then 1000times. I thought to myself: hm, this thing has possibilities. Here I am receiving my doctoral degree in August 2011. Computer science minors and would-be minors, I hereby address you in my capacity as the CS minor adviser. Each CS minor needs to fill out a CS minor plan; as long as it passes muster, I sign it, then you take it to your college adviser. Each minor plan consists of a three-quarter intro sequence and any four CMSC 200s. The form to be filled out is available online here:        https://college.uchicago.edu/sites/college.uchicago.edu/files/Consent_Minor_Program.pdf Once I have signed the form, any subsequent changes to the plan can be approved by email. If you haven\'t met with me yet, please contact me directly to set up an in-person appointment. Minor appointments always fit comfortably in a half hour. Are you not sure you want a CS minor? No problem: speculators, inquisitors, gadabouts and peripatetics are welcome.    I love music. A lot. This is some of the music I\'ve been listening to lately.        Beethoven\'s Piano Sonatas. These kind of ate my summer. If     you have some interest in the details of each sonata, I highly and     unreservedly     recommend Andras     Schiff\'s lecture series.    And these are some of the games I\'ve been playing lately: Spirit Island Cool anti-colonial co-op where your team gets more powerful as the game proceeds and, if all goes well, you smash the conquering gamebots to bits. Scythe Area control, resources, some combat. This game is perhaps overhyped, but it is, after all, a good one. The artwork is genuinely outstanding and sets it apart.   Pandemic   Legacy: Season 2 Excellent co-op game with an unfolding story. I   like this even better than Season 1. (We finished, and we won   December. Final score 771 IIRC.) Dominion, which I play with my brother. Last time we played, because we tied, the rules told us to "rejoice in our shared victory." And so we did.

Bio Diana Franklin is a Research Associate Professor in Computer Computer Science and Director of Computer Science Education at  UChicago STEM Education. She leads five projects involving  computer science education involving students ranging from  pre-K through university. She is the lead PI for quantum computing education for EPIQC, an NSF expedition in computing. Her research agenda explores ways to create curriculum and computing environments in ways that reach a broad audience. She is a   recipient of the NSF CAREER award, NCWIT Faculty Undergraduate  Mentoring Award, four teaching awards, three best paper  awards (ICER \'17, IPDPS \'14, and Computing Frontiers \'13), and  an Honourable Mention from CHI \'18. Franklin received her Ph.D. from UC Davis in 2002.  She was an assistant professor  (2002-2007) and associate professor with tenure (2007) in Computer  Science at the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis  Obispo, during which she held the Forbes Chair.   From 2008-2015, she was tenured teaching faculty at UC Santa Barbara. Her research  interests include computing education research, architecture involving novel technologies, and ethnic and gender diversity in computing.   She is the author of "A Practical Guide to Gender Diversity for CS  Faculty," from Morgan Claypool.                                     Currently Teaching   Winter 2019: CMSC 15200              ... More Classes ...                                      Research                I am interested in how students learn computer science concepts,  especially at the elementary school level. In particular, I  explore how to create curriculum and development environments that can reach a broad spectrum of learners, including underrepresented ethnic and gender minorities and students struggling academically. My research is  housed in the CANON (Computing for  ANyONe) Research Lab. I am leading five projects, spanning learners from pre-K through college.                                            active projects   Scratch Encore explores how to create intermediate Scratch curriculum when equity is a level-1 design constraint, equal to learning  outcomes. Our curriculum is being  released in waves as it is being piloted in 2018-19, with a broad roll-out in summer 2019. EPIQC, an NSF Expeditions in Computing, bridges the gap between algorithms that assume perfect hardware and near-term small, noisy hardware by  exposing specific details to algorithms developers, providing compiler optimizations, and developing architectural  innovations. I lead the quantum computing education and outreach for this project. In particular, we are creating and curating resources to teach a broad audience about  quantum computing principles. We currently have two efforts. First, tutorials for graduate students and professionals. Second, creating lessons with curated on-line resources  and our newly-created zines that begin appropriate for a  non-technical audience, gradually focusing to information necessary for a computer science undergraduate to be able to contribute to a research group. Future work will be integrated science / CT / quantum curriculum at middle school and high school levels, and undergraduate and graduate instructional materials. Learning Trajectories for Everyday Computing is a multi-institution research effort exploring integration of computational thinking and mathematics in elementary school. After creating learning trajectories for  Sequence, Repetition, Conditionals, and  Decomposition, we are designing Action Fractions, a  Fractions + CT curriculum for 3rd and 4th grades. This  curriculum will be piloted in several classrooms in 2018-19, with a broader roll-out in 2019-20. Comprehending Code focuses on learning strategies that students, especially  students  with disabilities, English language learners, and  those struggling academically for any other reason. We have developed TIPP&SEE, a strategy for focusing student learning on Scratch projects. In addition, we have developed resources for Robot Turtles to make it more accessible to  students in a classroom setting and to connect it more closely to Scratch programming. The first set of innovations were  tested successfully last year. The Scratch modifications will be piloted this year. CreaTive is a partnership between the University of Chicago Laboratory  School and CANON Research Lab. We are working together to  integrate CT into regular classroom instruction by  identifying CT skills that can be developed in and  applied to non-computing contexts. This effort focuses on  pre-K through 2nd grade, with 3rd-5th grade then moving to a makerspace emphasis with the micro-bit.           artifacts produced   Scratch Act 1 - Introductory Scratch programming. Four modules consisting of 10 hours of instruction. Uses same pedagogical approach as Scratch Encore, with content from SFUSD\'s Green Workbook, itself a reorganization and revision of Harvard\'s Creative Computing Curriculum. Scratch Encore - Intermediate Scratch programming. Modules 1-8 now released, new modules added weekly. Limited roll-out this year with full roll-out  in Autumn 2019. CT Reading List for preK-2nd grade. Robot Turtles boards to make the Robot Turtles preK-1st grade board game more amenable to classroom use. Action Fractions - Integrated fractions + CT activities for 3rd and 4th grade. Lessons being added every 2 weeks.                      older projects DEPICT Investigating how students learn elementary CT concepts through visual block-based languages (like Scratch) in upper-elementary school. This project resulted in 15 publications, a two-year curriculum, and a development environment that was more configurable than Scratch. The lessons learned in this program have now been applied to all of my current projects, and many of the projects live on in modified forms in the Scratch Encore curriculum.                 Animal Tlatoque Investigating how to broaden participation in computing through a  multi-disciplinary summer camp.  Over three summers, ran camp for  middle school students that combined meso-american culture, endangered species, art, storytelling, and computer science.

Revenue for the nine months ended September 2020 also increased by 10 per cent from $312.4 million to $343.9 million over the corresponding period of the previous year.    Stanley Motta, the real estate developer of 58 HWT in Kingston, attributed the improvement to the devaluation of the Jamaican dollar, which moved from an average of J$136.69:1US$ as at September 30, 2019, to J$143.95:1US$ at September 30, 2020.    The companys net operating income totalled $67.9 million for the three months ended September 2020, an increase of seven per cent from $62.9 million in the previous year. Its NOI, however, declined year-over-year, moving from $203.2 million for September 2019 to $186.1 million for the said period ended September 30, 2020, an eight per cent decrease.    This is due to the YTD impact of the FX loss. Without this loss, the company would have realised NOI of approximately $234.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, Stanley Motta said.    Net profit for the review quarter increased by 11 per cent, moving from $49.6 million in 2019 to $55 million. Stanley Mottas profit for the nine months ending September 2020 totalled $148 million, down from $165 million.    Administrative expenses for the year-to-date period represent an increase of 48.4 per cent over the prior year, moving from $109.9 million to $163.2 million. Similarly, there was a 14.8 per cent increase for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, when compared to that of September 30, 2019, moving from $43.5 million to $49.9 million.    Increases are due to a significant FX loss of $48.74 million arising from the revaluation of Stanley Mottas DBJ loan, SEZ fees, and repairs and maintenance and additional requirements based on its response to COVID 19, the company said.    Stanley Motta went on to note that it expects little fluctuations in its results through to the end of the financial year, based around earning rent in US dollar, continuing with close to 100 per cent occupancy and maintaining the status quo until year-end.Global stocks rise on more good news on vaccinesNovember 23, 2020Shamille ScottWorld stocks and Wall Street futures rose Monday after more good news on potential vaccines but unease about anti-coronavirus restrictions on businesses.    AstraZeneca said Monday that late-stage trials showed its coronavirus vaccine was up to 90 per cent effective. The UK-Swedish company is the third major drugmaker to report late-stage results for a potential COVID-19 vaccine.    That helped ease some investor concerns about decisions to reimpose anti-virus controls in the United States, Europe and some Asian countries that threaten to hamper retail spending, travel and other business activity.    In Europe, the DAX in Frankfurt added 0.5 per cent to 13,200 and the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.4 per cent to 5,517 after a survey of business activity showed a decline in November in the eurozone. The so-called PMI dropped to 45.1 points in November, below the 50 mark that separates economic contraction from expansion. The reading reflects the hit to businesses from lockdowns across the 19-country eurozone.    The FTSE 100 in London was flat at 6,349 after a similar survey also dropped, though not as sharply.    On Wall Street, the future for the benchmark S&P 500 index was up 0.5 per cent. That for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.6 per cent higher.    Investors awaited US economic growth data due out Wednesday after Wall Streets benchmark S&P 500 index ended last week down as rising infection numbers collided with hopes for a possible vaccine. Also Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve is to report on its latest meeting, though no surprises are expected.    In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.1 per cent to 3,414.49 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was 0.1 per cent higher at 26,486.20.    The Kospi in Seoul jumped 1.9 per cent to 2,602.59 and Sydneys S&P-ASX 200 added 0.3 per cent to 6,561.60.    India's Sensex advanced 0.5 per cent to 44,112.67. New Zealand and Southeast Asian markets also gained.    Investors are monitoring the prospects for more economic aid in the US, where last week Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was withdrawing emergency loan programs for small businesses. Congress is deadlocked on an aid plan to replace supplemental unemployment benefits that supported consumer spending and expired months ago.    Meanwhile, court decisions have rejected most of President Donald Trumps challenges of results of the November 3 election. Trump has fueled market jitters by refusing to concede or to brief Joe Biden's team on national security and anti-virus work.    Analysts at Mizuho Bank said in a report that blocking Bidens transition team from briefings means that precious time is stolen from tackling a resurgent health crisis that will extract an economic toll.    Mnuchins decision to withdraw emergency loan money, over the Feds opposition, undercut the central bank's ability to support recovery, Mizuho Bank said.    The Feds policy has been unnecessarily and prematurely denied the Treasurys backing," the bank said.    In energy markets, benchmark US crude rose 41 cents to $42.83 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 53 cents to $45.49 per barrel in London.    The dollar declined to 103.72 yen from Friday's 103.84 yen. The euro gained to $1.1905 from $1.1858.Tottenham loses more than $85m, debt climbs due to pandemicNovember 23, 2020Common reporting standard to be introduced to local tax systemNovember 22, 2020JBDC partners with US firm to help local businesses grow amid COVIDNovember 20, 2020Caribbean economies urged to invest in infrastructure to secure growthNovember 20, 2020More BusinessEntertainmentHeineken zero alcohol beer delights Food & Drink FestivalNovember 23, 2020krodgersIf the buzz on social media was any indication of the success of the 2020 edition of the Jamaica Food and Drink Festival (JFDF), then it was a hit.    This was due, in large part, to the festivals creative execution and brand partnerships that delivered on their promise.    Among the big winners was the JFDF partnership with non-alcohol brew Heineken 0.0, the latest innovation from the premium brand that launched on November 20, just in time for the festival.    Having successfully launched in 70 other markets around the world, Heineken 0.0 Rock landing was in the JFDF beer kits.    Bottles of Heineken 0.0, were accompanied by the Experience in a Box filled with fare from the ten master chefs.    The presentation of those boxes was just superb, so it fit perfectly with the kind of platform we needed for Heineken 0.0.    Each menu created by the amazing line up of chefs were superb making for a great partnership for the inclusiveness of Heineken 0.0 to all people, moments and drinking occasions, said Heineken Brand Manager Jodi Hylton.    Beer kits provided consumers with the choice of alcohol and non-alcohol beers.    The new Heineken 0.0 was prominently featured and contributed to the growing cultural trend of responsible alcohol consumption and living a balanced, healthy life.    Overall, we are very pleased with this years festival, Hylton mentioned, adding that the JFDFs execution matched the standards of Heinekens global #SocializeResponsibly campaign.    In addition to Heineken 0.0, the beer kit also included the original Heineken, Red Stripe Light and Red Stripe Flavours.    The food and beer pairing was a hit among JFDF supporters, according to festival manager Nasma Chin.    How can we execute differently with the same level of engagement this year? asked Chin.    This, especially in a year when the franchise had to pull out all the stops to impress and deliver value despite the restrictions.    This was the question that led us to create the Experience-in-a-Box series for JFDF2020.    We gave persons a taste of the flavours and vibe they expect from our event while keeping our chefs, sponsors and partners top of mind across our activations, said Nasma Chin, JFDF festival manager.    The highlight for many was being the first to taste Heineken 0.0, it was a perfect addition to the box creating a lot of excitement in a time when we needed it the most. Cheers to Heineken!    With 52 calories per bottle, 0.0 is targeting consumers who may have otherwise opted for a beverage without alcohol.    Now you can enjoy the same crisp refreshing taste as the original Heineken without the alcohol.    Our brand has always actively promoted responsible drinking and we are so happy to introduce a beer that our consumers can enjoy without worrying about getting behind the wheel or adding extra calories to their diet, Hylton explained.    Heineken 0.0 is brewed from scratch and has a perfectly balanced taste with refreshing fruity notes and soft malty body.    The brand is hoping that the new non-alcohol beer will create some excitement for existing beer lovers and provide an option for those who might call for a beer but not for the alcohol.Sanka teams up with Nickiesha for 'Best Wi Eva Feel'November 23, 2020Julian RichardsonDancehall singjay Sanka has carved out a reputation for hisintense lyrics and intoxicating delivery which makes him a versatile artistwhose music can travel well beyond the island's white sand shores.Sanka delivers hard bars and hard beats.

"Me and Nickiesha sit down and meds the song together. Mi just love her vibes from I met her when shewas a dancer on the set of my second video, 'Bad Position'. But when she unleash herself as an artiste, we just work with the inspiration and do this song," Sanka said.    A video for the project was also released on Friday the 13th.    "The streets say the song buzzing and can't wait to see the video drop...ah fire, straight fire," Sanka said confidently.    Sanka and Nickiesha, who are label mates on a partnership between IClips and Boysie Records, have hadno chance to perform the song because of the entertainment restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Underlining the impact created by the COVID-19 Pandemic, national diver, Yona Knight-Wisdom, said the money will be useful in attaining his Japan goal.    He said: 2020 has of course been difficult for everybody, but particularly for athletes in so many ways - spending so much time away from normal training, losing the chance to earn prize money from competitions and also the exposure that big events can bring. So its great to finally be back in full-time training, preparing for whatever 2021 brings.    But to have the financial backing of the JOA will help to give me that extra bit of motivation to work hard every day and be ready to compete to my highest level when the time comes, the 25-year-old added.    Knight-Wisdom created history in becoming the first athlete to represent Jamaica in Olympic diving competition, at the 2016 Games in Rio 2016. He explained that additional JOA funding will allow him to focus unilaterally on competition.    This investment will allow for me to get more physiotherapy to help look after my body, as well as to help pay for day-to-day training expenses such as travel, which means I can focus on the important things, he said. Hopefully this support will allow all of us to represent Jamaica to our highest level in Tokyo, because I believe a successful Olympics will bring joy and lift the spirits of the island as we come out of this terrible pandemic.    Skateboarding Jamaica Limiteds Tafari Whitter, who is chasing history on a quest to become the nations first Olympic representative in that discipline, expressed gratitude and relief that the finances will ease difficulties created by COVID-19.    I would like to say I am very proud of the JOA family on the fast track of $40 millionfor athletes preparation, due to COVID making things hard for most of us, said Whitter.    The JOA family managed to still keep things under control throughout these rough times and that is why I am so thankful and grateful for the opportunity of being part of history. Love you Jamaica. Lets go to Tokyo. I am so, so proud of the JOA family, he added.    Secretary General and CEO of the JOA, Ryan Foster, noted that 2020 is on in 2021 and the JOA, irrespective of the time of an event, is prepared for all seasons, all times, in solidly backing our national campaigners in their efforts to achieve timeless gains for country and self.    Foster added: Our business spreadsheet and strategic plan for Tokyo drill down to the minute and at every level there is the athlete. Every line item speaks to performance and the overall goal is 'Jamaica to the World.    Our Pathway to Success strategy is centred around the athlete and their development and this Olympic Invest initiative is yet another way of solidifying our goal to get 10 sporting disciplines in the next Olympic Games, the JOA exec added.    Olympic Invest is one of several recently instituted JOA projects that Foster says have borne athlete satisfaction.    The Internship and Scholarship programmes were well received and the athletes who have benefitted from both are well on their way to not only achieving on the field of play, but also in classroom and the boardroom, noted Foster.    Christopher Samuda, President of the JOA, reiteratedthe organisation's drive to develop athletes in a wholesome manner.    "The JOA is serious about powering our athletes in empowering them to achieve the gold medal yes, but more importantly the platinum pride of self-accomplishment, which is an invaluable dividend of 'Olympic Invest, said Samuda.    Sport takes a lot of investment to achieve sustainable growth and the JOA is pursuing a game plan that is long term in its gains - with short and medium milestones," he added.    Alton Brown, with sights firmly set on Olympic karate competition, has been achieving on the field of play. He is the number one ranked male karate athlete within the Caribbean, number two for his division across Pan America and number 22 in the world.    I have my eyes firmly set on two objectives: qualification and medal success at the Tokyo Games; and legacy within Jamaica Karate following the Games. This additional funding from the JOA will have a vital impact on my ability to continue to pursue and successfully reach those goals, Brown observed.    The movement towards qualification at these Games has been four years in the making and would not be possible without the JOAs support at key moments throughout this journey. In addition, the efforts of the Jamaica Karate Federation, under the leadership of Tony Robinson, have been instrumental in getting us to this moment.    Brown explained the rigours of qualification, which demands money.    Since 2018, the financial burden to the athlete of participating in the karate qualification process for Tokyo has been unprecedented, with almost 20 events taking place across five continents, he shared.    We have adapted well to the COVID-19 Pandemic, utilising relationships we hold with national teams across the Caribbean and Europe to continue development. This funding will not only allow us to be present at the final qualification events from February 2021, but also maximise the relationships we hold with other national teams, to ensure vital partner training opportunities necessary to continue to produce world-class results.    The world is taking note of Jamaica Karate and this additional funding will allow us to finish the race and make Jamaica proud, said Brown.Tottenham loses more than $85m, debt climbs due to pandemicNovember 23, 2020Shamille ScottPremier League leader Tottenham has reported annual losses of 63.9 million pounds ($85.4 million) due to the coronavirus pandemic and fans being shut out of stadiums.    We are currently in the midst of one of the most challenging times ever experienced," Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said Monday, announcing the financial results for the fiscal year ending June 30.    In 2018-19, Tottenham made a profit of 68.6 million pounds ($91.7 million) during its first partial season in its new 1.2 billion-pound ($1.6 billion) stadium. Fans haven't been allowed in to watch Jose Mourinho's side at the north London venue since March.    If coronavirus restrictions prevent supporters returning this season, which runs through May, Tottenham fears losing out on more than 150 million pounds ($200 million) in revenue. The 2019 Champions League finalists failed to qualify for this season after four years in Europe's elite and lucrative club competition.    Revenue dropped from 460.7 million pounds ($615.6 million) to 402.4 million pounds ($537.7 million) in 2019-20 as the season finished beyond the end of the financial year due to the pandemic. Tottenham's debt has climbed 13 per cent to 604.6 million pounds ($807.8 million).    Tottenham is hoping the development of COVID-19 vaccines will accelerate the return of fans to stadiums.    We have spent the past months preparing our stadium, testing our digital ticketing process and registering ID validation for fans," Levy said. Premier League clubs are entirely capable, similar to the experience in several other countries, of responsibly delivering outdoor events with social distancing, exemplary hygiene standards, qualified stewards, testing capabilities and diverse travel plans, operating in some of the most technologically advanced venues in the world.    Tottenham has just completed a weekend top of the league for the first time since 2014 after beating Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday.Patched-up Liverpool ease to statement win over LeicesterNovember 22, 2020The day belonged to jockey Dane Nelson and trainer Anthony NunesNovember 21, 2020It'll be Thiem-Medvedev, not Djokovic-Nadal, at ATP FinalsNovember 21, 2020Atletico beat Barcelona in league for first time in a decadeNovember 21, 2020More SportTrending59 new COVID cases, one deathNovember 23, 20205-year-old boy bitten by dogs stabilised; three of the animals locatedNovember 17, 202036,000 needy students to get $20,000 voucher towards laptop/tabletNovember 12, 202010 things to know about birthday girl Shelly-Ann Fraser-PryceDecember 27, 201910 Caribbean music festivals you need to visit in 2018/2019August 31, 2018Twitter FeedTweets by @LoopJamaicaPhoto GalleryCheck out our pics #WeLoveFoodWeekDigicel Foundation 5k PresentationPhotos from India and ChinaK's Golden Sea Moss by IyahreeceViva la Mexico!SectionsJamaica NewsWorld NewsSportsBusinessCoronavirusEntertainmentLifestyleOur EndzLoop NewsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseComments PolicyAbout UsContact UsSubmit an ArticleNewsletterPlease enter a valid email addressCopyright 2017 BY Trend Media | ALL RIGHTS RESERVEDMain navigationHomeJamaica NewsOpinionsWorld NewsCaribbean NewsFestivalsSportsBusinessTechCoronavirusEntertainmentLifestyleLoop LensTravelOur Endz33

The number of weekly Covid deaths in the capital jumped by 42 per cent, from 87 to 124. The total number of deaths from all causes in London rose to 1,112 139 more than average for the time of year. It came as the number of Covid deaths across the UK increased by 612 to 2,838 in the week to November 13, a rise of 27.5 per cent. But the figures show that London is the second least-affected area in the country for Covid deaths. Only the South West recorded fewer deaths in the most recent week a total of 100. There were 132 weekly deaths in East of England, 144 in the South East, 450 in Yorkshire and the Humber and 615 in the North West. Todays figures are the first that include the period of the second national lockdown, which began on November 5. However deaths are a lagging indicator, as they relate to infections caught about a fortnight earlier. This means the hoped impact of the lockdown in reducing rates could take a couple of weeks to be seen in the ONSs weekly figures. The figures come as the capital waits to find out which tier it will be placed into once lockdown ends on December 2. Boris Johnson announced on Monday that a beefed-up tier system will come into force at the end of the national shutdown, in a bid to control the spread of coronavirus. Several businesses are calling for London to be placed into Tier 2 - which would allow pubs, restaurants and bars to open with certain restrictions - rather than Tier 3, which bans the hospitality sector from opening, apart from for takeaway.read more...Bitcoin hits $19,000 for first time in three years, all-time high in sightBy Saikat Chatterjee LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin hit $19,000 on Tuesday for the first time in nearly three years, homingread more...HK to Shut Bars, Clubs; England Eases Quarantine: Virus Update(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong will shut bars and clubs as the city tightens social distancing rules amid a recent spikeread more...England to use testing to shorten quarantine for incoming passengersBy Estelle Shirbon LONDON (Reuters) - England will introduce a new system on Dec. 15 allowing passengers arriving from high-riskread more...Elbit Systems optimistic as it looks beyond third quarter one-off chargesBy Steven Scheer JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's Elbit Systems reported lower quarterly profit hit by one-time charges due to theread more...Health Ministry names regions with highest incidence of COVID-19As of November 24, the highest incidence of COVID-19 in Ukraine was recorded in Sumy, Cherkasy, Chernivtsi and Kyiv regions, according to data provided by the Health Ministry.read more...Irish consumer sentiment hits highest level since March as COVID-19 cases fallDUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish consumer sentiment rose sharply this month to its highest level since March, in contrast to declinesread more...Tech giants ask Malaysia PM to reinstate foreign ship cable waiver - reportKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Microsoft, Google and Facebook have asked Malaysia's Prime Minister to reinstate an exemption allowing non-Malaysian shipsread more...Brexit news live: Boris Johnson defeated again in Lords, as no-deal to cost more than CovidThe House of Lords has voted to force Boris Johnsons government to seek the consent of the devolved administrations before ministers can exercise powers contained in No 10s controversial Internal Market Bill. It comes as Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has said that a no-deal Brexit would cause even more long-term damage to the UKs economy than the coronavirus pandemic. The influential figure told MPs a deal was in the best interests of both sides. It follows an optimistic assessment of trade talks by Irish premier Michel Martin, who revealed legal texts were now in play on all areas of the prospective trade deal. I would be hopeful that by the end of this week we could see the outline of a deal, said Mr Martin.

Property price information may not be available for all properties, is for personal domestic use only and may change daily. Actual sale prices may be different.Back to topThe ANZ Personal Loans calculator is intended as a guide only and actual borrowing capacity may vary. Amounts calculated do not constitute a quote or loan approval by ANZ and does not take into account your personal or financial circumstances.Back to topOpen your first ANZ Online Saver account and you'll receive an introductory fixed bonus rate of% p.a. for 3 months, on top of the ANZ Online Saver standard variable rate (currently). After 3 months, the ANZ Online Saver standard variable rate, applicable at that time, will apply. The introductory fixed bonus rate is only available on the first ANZ Online Saver account opened by customers who have not held an ANZ Online Saver in the last 6 months. In case of joint account holders, the introductory fixed bonus rate offer will only be received if all customers are eligible.Back to topBonus interest is subject to eligibility. ANZ Progress Saver pays bonus interest (in addition to the current variable base interest) in respect of a particular month if the set minimum deposit (currently $10) and no withdrawals, fees or charges are processed to the account on or before the last business day of that calendar month, and after the last business day of the previous calendar month. Bonus and base rates are variable and subject to change.Back to topA minimum deposit of $5,000 is required to open an ANZ Advance Notice Term Deposit or an ANZ Term Deposit. This calculator has been set to a maximum deposit of $4,999,999. However, investments of $100,000 or more may be subject to different interest rates than those provided in this calculator. Please call13 33 33or visit your nearestANZ Branchto discuss your term and interest rate for an investment of $100,000 or more.Back to topEarly withdrawal fees may apply. An administration fee of $30 will be charged and the account will incur an interest reduction in respect of the money withdrawn or transferred early. An ANZ Advance Notice Term Deposit has a 31 day notice period. This means that if you request an early withdrawal or transfer of all or part of your funds, the funds will not be provided until the 31stday after the request (or the next business day). Refer to theANZ Saving and Transaction Products Terms and Conditions (PDF 746kB)for further details.Back to topInterest rates current as atand subject to change at any time. Different interest rates apply to each term deposit product and to different investment amounts, term lengths and interest frequencies. Early withdrawal fees may apply. Special term rates do not quality for bonus interest rates and are not available in conjunction with any other bonus or special interest rate offer. For Advance Notice Term Deposits, this applies to investment terms of 3, 6, 10 and 12 months, as well as all term lengths of greater than 12 months. For Term Deposits, this applies to all term lengths.Back to topThe principal difference between an ANZ Advance Notice Term Deposit and an ANZ Term Deposit (apart from the interest rate that applies) is that you must provide 31 days notice to ANZ if you wish to make an early withdrawal or transfer of all or part of your funds from an ANZ Advance Notice Term Deposit account.
