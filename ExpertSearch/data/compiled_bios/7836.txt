My research interests currently include the evolution of galaxies andclusters of galaxies,binary stars, and supernovae. I also work on computer science/applied mathematics topics such as parallelnumerical algorithm development,simulation codearchitecture, and grid-enabledcyberinfrastructurefor astrophysics.
