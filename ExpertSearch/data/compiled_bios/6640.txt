AIAA Associate FellowASEE Experimental Subsonic AerodynamicsWind tunnel facilities are used to examine overall and detailed flowfields on wings, aircraft and non-aeronautical shapes including automobiles, ships, high speed trains, buildings and structures. Past research topics have ranged from studies of wing-tip and leading edge vortex aerodynamics to low Reynolds number wing aerodynamics.Experimental Fluid DynamicsWind and water tunnels and other special purpose facilities are used to study internal flow fields through engine inlets and nozzles, within the core of a solid rocket engine and in vehicle interiors.Wind EngineeringWind tunnel studies to examine the effects of winds around non-aeronautical shapes such as buildings, structures, signs, outdoor lighting, etc. Websites AIAA ASEE Software for AOE 3014 IKELOS (A super short take-off and landing aircraft) Pegasus (A modern "roadable aircraft" or flying car) The Venture (An advanced amphibian general aviation aircraft) GradAdvising UndergraduateAdvising Seminars Calendars Forms InternalUse College of Engineering COEFacultyResourcesforIntl.Programs KevinT.CroftonDepartmentof AerospaceandOceanEngineering(MC0203) RandolphHall, RM215, VirginiaTech 460OldTurnerSt. Blacksburg,VA24061-0203 Phone:540-231-6611 Fax:540-231-9632 Get Directions See All Locations Contact Virginia Tech University Status Principles of Community Privacy Statement Acceptable Use We Remember University Libraries Accessibility Consumer Information Stop Abuse Policies Equal Opportunity WVTF University Bookstore Jobs at Virginia Tech Strategic Plan 2020 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.
