Approaches Ecological and evolutionary forecasting and hindcasting: We are using historic data on species traits from museum specimens and performance from lab and field studies to assess phenotypic shifts and their influence on species responses to recent climate change. Mechanistic models of species ranges in changing environments: We develop mechanistic models that scale from individual performance and energetics to population and community dynamics and predict abundance and distribution patterns. Physiological, energetic, and ecological constraints on abundance, distribution, and diversity: Ecoinformatics enables us to ask how the evolution of physiological traits constrains broad-scale patterns of abundance, distribution, and diversity. Outreach and Education: We develop computational tools to translate physical climate changes into impacts on organisms. The tools enable assessing the ecological consequences of given warming. We also teach courses on physiological and global change ecology and evolution and participate in outreach activities aimed at disseminating information about the ecological impacts of climate change.

In our longitudinal study we showed that w each additional same gender mentor students had 2x greater chance of staying in the geosciences... But then again we didn't define success as number of papers published... https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19723-8#MOESM1Reply on Twitter 1328933301038542850Retweet on Twitter 1328933301038542850194Like on Twitter 1328933301038542850801Twitter 1328933301038542850lauren buckley@ecolforecaster18 NovLaunching our new TrEnCh project website by @impactmedialab!
