S. Association for Computational Mechanics2005 Chair, executive committee of Applied Mechanics Division of ASME2009- present, Visiting Distinguished World Class University Professor of Sung Kyun Kwan University, KoreaIn the Classroom Finite Element Methods in Mechanics To learn the basic theory behind the finite element method (FEM); how to program the finite element method using MATLAB as a programming tool; to learn a general commercial FEM code to write interface programs and solve typical engineering problems. Finite Elements for Design and Optimization The scope of the course is to provide the analytical and computational tools necessary for the design of complex structural and material systems for modern engineering applications, ranging from structural engineering to micro and nanotechnology. Advanced Finite Element Methods I Gain theoretical, programming, and application knowledge of nonlinear finite element methods. Understand the associated continuum mechanics and its finite element implementation and applications. Advanced Finite Element Methods II Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulations, Non-linear materials, and introduction to computational fracture mechanics; using ABAQUS, programming VUMAT, UMAT. Multi-scale Modeling and Simulation in Solid Mechanics Understand the underlying principles of molecular dynamics. Gain proficiency in designing molecular dynamics simulations using available software (LAMMPS). Understand the connection between information available on small (atomistic) and large (continuum) scales. Applications: Nanostructure materials: Nanowires: single crystal Si. Nano Carbons: nanotube; Polymer nano-composite: polymer mechanics, polymer and polymer-fillers modeling; Multi-scale modeling.
