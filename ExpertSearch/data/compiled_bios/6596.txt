Infrastructure Institute (UCII) People Arthur J Helmicki Professor, CEAS - Elec Eng & Computer Science 818 Rhodes Hall 513-556-6069 helmicaj@ucmail.uc.edu The focus of my research and teaching have been in the core area of Systems/Controls, with specialization in the development and application of practical, nondestructive evaluation techniques for damage identification, system identification and parameter estimation, condition assessment, health monitoring, remote monitoring/sensing, and associated information technologies. This includes the development of all necessary hardware, software, and algorithms for instrumentation, signal processing and data interpretation. I have worked on extensive application of these techniques in the areas of civil infrastructure systems, biomedicine, and aerospace.

My history of multi-disciplinary projects demonstrates my ability and interest in the development and application of practical ideas and techniques to important and timely problems that cross several fields of expertise and draw from many sciences. I have developed hardware, software, and algorithms for signal processing, data interpretation, insitu control, and automated reporting. I have worked on extensive application of these techniques, specifically in the areas of civil infrastructure systems, materials science, and aerospace. Structural testing and monitoring, with extensive background with highway bridges. Environmental monitoring and alerting, with specific application to icing and snow accumulation (and shedding) on highway features. Unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) flights and applications for the DOT, with particular results in photogrammetic models, surveying, structural and facility inspection, video monitoring and processing of traffic parameters, event documentation and social networking and planning, etc. View Full Profile James A. Swanson Associate Professor, CEAS - Civil Eng 765D Baldwin Hall 513-556-3774 swansojs@ucmail.uc.edu View Full Profile Randall J Allemang Emeritus, CEAS - Mech Eng and Materials Eng allemarj@ucmail.uc.edu Dr. Allemang is a Professor Emeritus and member of the faculty of the Mechanical Engineering Program in Mechanical and Materials Engineering, University of Cincinnati, where he currently also serves as Director of the Structural Dynamics Research Laboratory (UC-SDRL). Dr. Allemang has been actively involved in the area of experimental structural dynamics and modal analysis for over forty years, pioneering the use of multiple input, multiple output estimation of frequency response functions, developing the concept of cyclic averaging, formulating the modal assurance criterion (MAC) and the enhanced frequency response function and reformulating modal parameter estimation algorithms into the unified matrix (coefficient) polynomial approach (UMPA). Dr. Allemang has served on the Advisory Board for the International Modal Analysis Conference (1981-2015, Chairman, 1986-1995) and on the Editorial Board of Sound and Vibration Magazine. Dr. Allemang has also served on the Executive Board of Society of Experimental Mechanics (SEM) from 1998-2006, including President for the Society during 2003-2004. Dr. Allemang is currently involved as Senior Collaborator for the AFRL Structural Sciences Center at WPAFB, working on the verification and validation (experimental quantification of margin and uncertainty) of experimental and analytical dynamic models and has been recognized by three professional societies as a Fellow (SEM, SAE and ASME). Dr. Allemang has also mentored two PhD graduates who went on to win Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE).
