The feature is located at the center of Messier 87 a giant elliptical galaxy in the constellation Virgo. Astronomers Capture First Image of a Black HoleThe Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration was designed to capture images of a black hole.
