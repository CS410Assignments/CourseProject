Given the indications that these vaccines are effective, the question now turns to when they can be rolled out to the public.Last week, Pfizer asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve its vaccine for emergency use. The FDA will meet to make that call on December 10. Unlike Moderna, which received $2.5 billion to develop its mRNA vaccine from the U.S. governments Operation Warp Speed, Pfizer did not use government money to develop its vaccine. But it did sign a $1.95 billion agreement in July to sell 100 million doses of the vaccine to the federal government.Pfizer says it will have 50 million doses available by the end of the year, but only half of those doses will go to the United States, and since each person requires two doses to be immunized from the virus, we could see up to 12.5 million Americans immunized by the end of the year. This wont be an easy task, however: State governments will have to handle the logistics of deciding who gets the vaccine first (health care workers are most likely to be at the front of the line) and how to administer it to them, while transporting and storing the vaccine at sub-Antarctic temperatures.What Investors Got Wrong About the Pfizer Vaccine NewsThe market is treating it like an impossible-to-predict black swan eventbut its notmarker.medium.comFor much of the rest of the world, hopes ride on the availability of the vaccine from AstraZeneca and Oxford University, a large quantity of which is being produced by Indias Serum Institute for low- and middle-income countries, with an assist from the Gates Foundation.A little patience this holiday season can help more of us make it to the next one.For more Number of the Day, follow Marker Editors.Written byMarker EditorsFollow215 1 Sign up for Buy/Sell/HoldBy MarkerA newsletter that's 100% business intelligence, and 0% investment advice.Take a lookGet this newsletterBy signing up, you will create a Medium account if you dont already have one.
