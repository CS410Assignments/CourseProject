He is currently located on the Boise campus of the University of Idaho the director of the Center for Ecohydraulics Stream Laboratory, a $2M+ facility with multi-university participation. Budwig received his doctorate from Johns Hopkins University in 1985 and has worked as a guest researcher in several laboratories in the United States and Canada since that time. His areas of specialization include experimental and theoretical fluid dynamics; turbulence; optical, acoustic, and thermal measurements techniques; and experimental methods. Budwig has taught extensively in the experimental methods area including required undergraduate courses as well as a specialized graduate level course on the subject of experimental methods in fluid dynamics.
