Dramatically increased systems complexity, large numbers of actors and agents, and vast numbers of interfaces challenge engineers to master multiple disciplines and perspectives ranging across design, operations, and decision making, from the qualitative to the quantitative. The Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering is committed to developing and integrating the knowledge and tools necessary to create an engineering discipline of complex systems. This discipline borrows heavily from traditional engineering knowledge in industrial engineering, systems engineering, operations research, and computation; it couples these with insights drawn from economics, policy, business, communications, social science, and mathematics. Data Analytics Our departments advanced Data Analytics program is focused on five core areas of research and course development: statistics and data analysis, operations research and decision sciences, computing and computational methods, and enterprise and business fundamentals.Faculty and Courses Decision and Control Systems Control Systems includes identification, modeling, analysis, and control of dynamic systems. Applications range from controlling robotic arms for tele-surgery to modeling and controlling economic markets; from temperature control in our homes and office buildings to control of unmanned vehicles, rockets, and robots. Faculty and Courses Design and Manufacturing This area of research creates tools, methods, and processes to optimize products or systems in a wide variety of domains with associated complexities: bio-inspired compliant structures and mechanisms, robotics, co-design of physical and control systems, sustainable product design taking into account global supply chains, product lifecycle and technology policy.Faculty and Courses Financial Engineering Financial Engineering students are trained with fundamental economic and finance theory as well as state-of-the-art mathematical, statistical, and computing techniques.Faculty and Courses Operations Research Operations Research is a discipline that deals with the development and application of advanced analytical methodologies to provide decision support to complex decision-making problems in business, industry, government, and other enterprises.Faculty and Courses Related News Professor Kesavadas and colleagues develop robot to kill COVID-19 Harrison Kim receives DOE award to reinvent steel production using magnetic fields Kim joins Material Sciences Professor Dallas Trinkle and University of Florida Professor and Chair Michele V.
