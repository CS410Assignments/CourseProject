" Ann Reimers, Assistant Professor of Engineering Dr. Ann Reimers is a General FacultyAssistant Professorwith joint appointments in the Department of Engineering & Society and the Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering. Shecurrently teaches Introduction to Engineering Lab and Dynamics. She has also taught Introduction to Engineering Lecture and served asa first year academic advisor and a member of the First-year Experience Committee in the School of Engineering and Applied Science. She was Acting Director of Student Success, part of the SEAS Undergraduate Dean's Office,during the Spring of 2018 . As an electro/mechanical engineer, she worked in the areas of vibration control, magnetostrictive material modeling, and submarine silencing. Then deciding to focus on education, she taught high school science, primarily physics, for ten years and functioned as Science Department Chair and Dean of Faculty. During the 2014-15 academic year, she served inthe Department of Energy's Office of Science as an Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellow. She focuses her work at UVa on increasing the availability of hands-on, cross-curricular engineering experiences for students, improving student confidence in choosing their disciplinary path and facilitating student success. She has presented and published in the educational areaof integrating hands-on and engaging material related to engineering and science into K-12 classrooms and extracurricular settings. Her technical publications involve magnetic and magnetostrictive material modeling and control.
