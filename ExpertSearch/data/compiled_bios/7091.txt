He was also a six-time letterman at Georgia Tech in football and track and field. Dr. Frakes was awarded the 2012 National Science Foundation CAREER Award and the 2014 World Technology Network Award in Health and Medicine, both for his pioneering work in simulation-based planning for endovascular interventions. The associated company that he co-founded, EndoVantage, was acquired by RapidAI in 2020. Dr. Frakes was also named the 2014 Innovator of the Year in the state of Arizona for his novel contributions to 3D printing-based planning for congenital heart defect repair. He joined Google in 2015 where he led research behind Lens, Googles visual search engine. He then joined Apple in 2019 where he served as Lead of Camera Software for the iPhone 11 family of products. Dr. Frakes is now a jointly appointed associate professor at Georgia Tech in Biomedical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering.
