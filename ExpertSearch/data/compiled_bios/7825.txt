Green St. Urbana, IL 61801 (217) 244-3615 lwl@illinois.edu Research AreasGalaxies and ISMInstrumentationObservationStars and Planets Edit Your Profile Director - Laboratory for Astronomical Imaging, Chair, Professor Research DescriptionMy group studies the cutest stars - big and cuddly protostars only 10,000 to 100,000 years old, before they turn punky and begin to fuse hydrogen into helium in their core in about 1 million years. These stars are surrounded by envelopes of dust and gas that give us direct evidence of how stars form and how early planetary systems are going to form. Lately, we have been most excited about 1) how circumstellar disks evolve from the earliest stages and what impact the disk has on the evolution of planets via dust grain growth, and 2) the polarization of light from the circumstellar disk which arises from three mechanisms, aligned dust grains via magnetic field, aligned dust grains from radiation, and/or scattering. The sources we study are usually deeply embedded in gas and dust, which means that they can only be observed at wavelengths longer than 10 microns. Thus, our group typically utilizes ALMA, SOFIA, and VLA observations to peer into stellar nurseries. However, lately I am also considering variability of sources in LSST.

Congratulations to the Astronomy Class of 2019Congratulations to the Astronomy Class of 2019! Best wishes on your future endeavors--you make us proud! Twelve Astronomy and CS+Astronomy seniors graduated on May 12, 2019 at Krannert Center for the Performing Arts. Illinois Astronomer Helps Reveal Extragalactic Magnetic FieldIllinois Prof Looney was among the science team that released a beautiful image of the dust inferred magnetic field in two galaxies. The Cigar Galaxy (M82), shown here, has its large-scale magnetic field following the bipolar outflows (red) generated by the intense nuclear starburst. Illinois Astronomers Help to Uncover Clues to the Evolution of the UniverseIllinois Profs Looney and Crutcher and grad student Erin Cox were among the science team that released a beautiful image of the dust inferred magnetic field in the Orion nebula using SOFIA HAWC+ observations. Prof. Erin Cox Earns PhDErin Cox successfully defended her PhD thesis on July 2, 2018. Congratulations, Dr. Cox! Department of AstronomyUniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign 1002 W.
