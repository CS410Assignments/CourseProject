Materials Engineering at UK Program Educational Objectives Undergraduate Admission Graduate Admission Visit Us Research Areas Breakthrough technologies require more than just rearranging or reshaping the parts and materials already available to us. Solving societal problems, both big and small, by revolutionizing whats possible requires new materials with transformational properties and capabilities. Materials Engineers leverage math, chemistry, and physics as tools to understand, control, and design the materials we use to make thingsenabling and implementing solutions to problems in all areas of science, technology and medicine. <10:1Student to faculty ratio 46%of UK MSE majors are women 47%of MSE grads have research experience at graduation 79%of MSE grads have industry experience at graduation $66,370Average starting salary of UK BSMSE grads Paul Rottmann Publishes Paper in Science Rottmann worked on the paper, titled,"Multiplicity of Dislocation Pathways in a Refractory Multi-Principal Element Alloy,"with a team from the University of California at Santa Barbara.
