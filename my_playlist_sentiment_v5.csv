Hope I don't regret this

I can't keep my focus
It's too much to resist

I'm over being under your spell
It keeps blinding me
Was too blind to see, yeah
I'm not the only one that you tell
That I'm the only one

But, my heart keeps telling me the perfect lie
You rip me up with every last goodbye
I don't wanna say forever
It's just another now or never
So heart, don't let me trust these butterflies
I don't trust these butterflies

And trust me I'll give a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Do you know I want your love?
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me""
Come on now, follow my lead

I showed him all the things that he didn't understand

Now, there's one in California who's been cursing my name
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK
Hey, hey, until I made my getaway

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

""How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?""

If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything

You think I'm crying on my own, well, I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
You still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself

Starts to make its way to me

Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

While y'all slippin' he's runnin' the game
Now big bang boogie
Get that kitty little noogie
In a nice, nice little shade
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said
Walk this way

I was born in a flame
Mama said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best you've ever had (that's right)
If you think I'm burning out, I never am

I'm on fire

Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what am I supposed to do?

Could it be a possibility?

Sometimes I tend to lose myself when I'm out here on my own
I never seem to get it right, but I guess that's how it goes
Ever since you came around, can't nobody hold me down
You showed me how to find myself when I needed it the most

I been up all night, no sleep

But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes-, six minutes-)
Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)

This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""Bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students

Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame

And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me

I'll be one tough act to follow

But you have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto

Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes

And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick from unda cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts

Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

I know you said he's just a dog astray
He is a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

But mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational
It's physical
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
All reasons aside, I just can't deny
Love the guy

He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun

Can I get a ""hell no""?

'Till we see the sunlight, alright (Hey, hey, hey)

Dancing with Molly
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
This is our rules

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?

If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still

你大可不必為難 找般配
付出過的人排隊 談體會
趁年輕別害怕一個人睡

可能是現在感情 太昂貴
讓付出真心的人 好狼狽
還不如聽首情歌 的機會 忘了誰

感情像牛奶一杯 越甜越讓人生畏
都早有些防備 潤色前的原味
所以人們都拿起咖啡 把試探放在兩人位
距離感一對 就不必再赤裸相對

Got down on my knees, prayed to God to give life

Flew the skies still dreaming for a change

We're the ghosts in the wall
Silently we're the fighters (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

I wanna feel it, feel it, feel it

I tend to handle things usually by myself
And I can't ever seem to try and ask for help

I'd be the Prom Queen if crying was a contest

Thought I'd get to them, but no I didn't

Provide loving, overlooked and unappreciated, you see? (Yeah)

You can't reciprocate, I got delicious taste
You need a woman's touch in your place
Just protect her and keep her safe
Baby, worship my hips and waist
So feminine with grace
I touch your soul when you hear me say
""(Boy), let me be your woman""

Starry night
Paint your palette blue and grey
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the
Darkness in my soul.
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land.

And now I understand what you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free.
They would not listen
They did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now.

Starry
Starry night
Flaming flo'rs that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze reflect in

Baby you're unusual
반짝거리는 shape
넌 날 끌리게 해

Baby you're unusual
비틀거리는 나는
뭔가 필요해 많이

Woo baby
흐트러진 내 맘을 잡아줘
이 어둠 속에서

알고 지냈던 듯이
반갑게 날 맞아줘
아침엔 다시 남일 텐데

밤새도록

난 또 잠이 오질 않아
긴 밤이 오니까 널 데려가잖아
애써 돌아서기에도 아쉬워

텅 빈 이 방안 속
텅 빈 이 공기를
견디지 못하고
혼자 서 있어

즐거이 웃다가도
밤이 되고 또 혼자가 돼
Maybe I'm so lonely
Everyday 공허한 이 밤이 내게서 널 가져가

긴 밤이 오니까 널 데려가니까
난 또 잠이 오질 않아
긴 밤이 오니까 널 데려가잖아
애써 돌아서기에도 아쉬워

긴 밤 아 오지 마 날 데려가지 마

What's wrong with me?
Cyndi, give me your love
You make me sneeze all the time

Now now 怎麼我一直狂打噴嚏

Let me sing let me sing a song
陪妳入睡 yo yo what is love?
Say yes 嗯哼我正在聽 say yes
Yo yo 妳要什麼都 say yes
Cyndi I really do love you so

如果你突然打了個噴嚏
那一定就是我在想你
如果半夜被手機吵醒
啊那是因為我關心

常常想你說的話是不是別有用心

Now that I'm famous, I got — all around me
