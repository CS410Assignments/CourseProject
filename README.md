### Project Overview
Our chosen topic is a tourist-oriented restaurant concierge service designed for travelers with limited time in a city who seek the best dining experiences during their short stay. Our objective is to develop an application that streamlines the process of finding top-rated restaurants for tourists. The application will predominantly feature a user-friendly command-line interface, simplifying the user's interaction with our service. This project is intriguing because it addresses a common pain point for travelers. When visiting a new city, tourists often struggle to find the best restaurants, leading to time-consuming research on platforms like Google Maps and Yelp. Our application will save users time and effort, providing a curated list of top restaurants based on their preferences and constraints. The expected outcome is a functional and user-friendly restaurant concierge application that simplifies the process of finding the best dining options for tourists during their short trips.

We intend to use the Yelp Open dataset as the primary source of restaurant information. The application will prompt users to answer questions about their trip, such as location (state and city), trip length, and dining preferences. Based on this input, the application will query the dataset and generate a list of top restaurants, categorized by their locations, ensuring that travelers can make the most of their visit. As a stretch goal beyonds MVP, we could to introduce advanced features, such as budget considerations, party size, reservation information, and specific preferences like waterfront views or suitability for romantic dinners, to enhance the user's dining experience. We will evaluate the application's success by assessing its ability to generate relevant restaurant recommendations. User feedback and satisfaction will be key evaluation criteria, ensuring that the tool meets the needs of its target audience. We may conduct user surveys or tests to gather insights for further improvements.

### Project Language
We intend to utilize Python as our backend programming language. The Yelp Open dataset will serve as the primary data source. Additionally, we may incorporate relevant APIs or libraries to enrich the user experience. At this time, we do not anticipate the use of an external database or the development of a dedicated frontend. The application will primarily feature a command-line interface, providing a user-friendly platform for easy interactions.
