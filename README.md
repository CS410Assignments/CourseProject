## Installation
1. Create a virtual environment using conda:
`conda create -n [your-env-name] python=3.6 anaconda`
e.g. `create -n vpr python=3.6 anaconda`

2. Activate the virtual environment
`conda activate [your-env-name]`
e.g. `conda activate vpr`

3. Install the packages in requirements.txt
`conda install --file requirements.txt`

## Running the Django server
Running the Django server
While in the CourseProject folder, cd into VPR, list of the files and folders and you will see a file called manage.py. Run the following command:
`python3 manage.py runserver`

A browser with the application will pop-up.

## Shutting down the Django server
If you want to shutdown the Django server, you can do `ctrl+c` in the terminal to shut down the server. You can also deactivate the virtual environment with this command `conda deactivate`.
