# CourseProject

Please fork this repository and paste the github link of your fork on Microsoft CMT. Detailed instructions are on Coursera under Week 1: Course Project Overview.

Note: Rotten Tomatos has a relatively complex web structure. Even though the code for looking into the movie profile link is completed in the scraper.py, it takes a while for the program to obtain that information. Right now this part of the code is commented out.
