# Project Proposal
Private ChatGPT-Like System with Local Integration

## Overview
This project aims to develop a private, fine-tuned ChatGPT-like system that integrates with local data sources, such as GitHub repositories and PDF files. The system will enable users to interact with a chatbot that can provide information based on the integrated local sources, and users can add, remove, or update the knowledge base as needed.

## Features
- **Local Data Integration**: Integrate with local sources like GitHub repositories, PDF files, etc., to use as a knowledge base.
- **Knowledge Base Management**: Ability to add, remove, and update the knowledge base.
- **Chat Interface**: Implement a chat interface for querying the system.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Since the system is local and private, it ensures data privacy and security.

## Potential Tools
- **LangChain**: For orchestrating the integration of different components and data sources.
- **OpenAI APIs**: For accessing advanced language model capabilities.
- **Local GPT + LLMA2**: For creating a local language model that can be fine-tuned and controlled.
- **Vector Database**: Either remote or local, for efficient data storage and retrieval.
