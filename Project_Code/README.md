# BM25 Page Searcher
___
## Overview

While researching a topic, have you ever wished you could prioritize applicable content on a long webpage? Have you ever used Ctrl+F only to find that your search yields literally hundreds of results on the same page? If you answered "Yes" to either of the previous questions, then you will find BM25 Page Searcher useful!

BM25 Page Searcher does exactly what its name implies: it performs [BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) search on the current webpage. Simply put, this allows users to prioritize the most relevant parts of a webpage over less relevant parts of a webpage. Relevance, in this case, is based on the user-inputted query.

## How to Install

Go to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) and search for "BM25". Install the extension just like you would with any other extension.

## How to Use
When browsing, quickly access the extension by pressing Ctrl+Shift+S. This will open up the extension's popup and allow you to input a query, cycle through the most relevant paragraphs, and adjust the parameters of the BM25 algorithm (if you are so inclined).
