# Project Progress Report - Milestones 1, 2, and 3
Date: Nov 19, 2023

## Completed Tasks
### Milestone 1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration
- **Technology Stack Selection**: We have successfully chosen Python as our primary programming language, making it easier to integrate various components.
- **LangChain Setup**: LangChain has been installed and configured following the official documentation.
- **Vector Database Selection**: We have chosen Faiss as our vector database system and have installed and configured it.
- **Frontend Framework**: Streamlit has been selected as our frontend framework, and we have set up a basic Streamlit application.

### Milestone 2: Implementing Knowledge Base Management
- **Data Schema Definition**: A clear data schema for storing text embeddings in the vector database has been defined.
- **CRUD Operations**: We have implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for the knowledge base, and Python functions for each operation are in place.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Our Streamlit-based user interface has been developed, and it integrates seamlessly with the CRUD operations.
- **Access Control and Security**: User authentication and authorization mechanisms have been implemented to control knowledge base access.

### Milestone 3: Integrating LangChain and LLM
- **LLM API Installation**: The LLM API has been successfully installed using pip, and we have followed the official documentation for setup.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Our language model (GPT-3) has been fine-tuned on our private data, and it is capable of controlled responses.
- **Real-Time Data Integration (Optional)**: We have explored options for real-time data integration and are working on mechanisms for immediate updates.

## Pending Tasks
We are currently moving forward with the project and are preparing for Milestone 4, which involves integrating the frontend and conducting user testing.

## Challenges
- While we have made significant progress, the integration of real-time data updates with the language model is proving to be a complex task. We are actively researching the best approach to achieve this seamlessly.
- User testing for the frontend is scheduled, but we anticipate potential usability issues that will require further refinement.

Overall, the project is progressing well, and we are on track to deliver the MVP as planned.

## Milestone 2: Implementing Knowledge Base Management
### Objective
Develop the functionalities to add, remove, and update data in the private knowledge base.

### Execution Steps
1. **Define Data Schema**
   - Decide on the structure for storing text embeddings in the vector database.
   - Create a clear schema for the data to be added.

2. **Develop CRUD Operations**
   - Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for the knowledge base.
   - Create Python functions for each operation.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Build a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.
   - Integrate CRUD operations with the interface.
   
4. **Access Control and Security**
   - Implement user authentication and authorization for managing the knowledge base.
   - Set up role-based access control.

## Milestone 3: Integrating LangChain and LLM
### Objective

### Execution Steps
1. **Install LLM API**
   - Use pip to install the LLM API.
   - Follow the official LLM API documentation for setup and usage.

2. **Fine-Tuning**
   - Fine-tune the selected language model (e.g., GPT-3) on your private data.
   - Ensure that the fine-tuned model can be controlled effectively.

3. **Real-Time Data Integration (Optional)**
   - Investigate options for real-time data integration between the knowledge base and the language model.
   - Develop mechanisms for immediate updates.

## Milestone 4: Frontend Integration and User Testing
