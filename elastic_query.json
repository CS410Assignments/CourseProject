"Sorry it's very complicated to tell this in English for me. Here is my problem. I have this list: s=[\"2.11\", \"4.7.0\", \"1.3\", \"2.2\", \"0.1\", \"1.2.5\", \"1.3.1\", \"2.7\"]  I want these numbers ordered by from smallest to biggest. But not mathematicallly, not quite. For version numbers concept. Think them as like version numbers. Not ordinary math. For ordinary math, 2.2>2.11 but for program version numbers concept, it's 2.11>2.2 So I need to somehow order them like that. First thing came in my mind was this. Maybe get those 11, 7, 3, 2 numbers from there that is split from dots. Then compare them, problem is how to get them out? I tried various solutions from stackoverflow. For example 2.11's 11 is this : print(s[0][2:len(s[0])]) # prints 11  Since this list is actually two dimentional array like you, many solutions don't work for me. Please help. Or am I missing something? Is there a much simpler way to do this? Expected output is below. Think that this returns from a function: 0.1,1.2.5,1.3,1.3.1,2.2,2.7,2.11,4.7  "

"I have an array with random colors. There are duplicate elements. For example: mass = ['white','black','white'...]  I need to count them so I've decided to use Counter: mass_count = Counter(mass) print (mass_count)  What I've got I want to display each element of the dictionary on a new line. I've used that code: keys = [k for k in mass_count] for i, key in enumerate(keys):           print(\"\\n\" + str(list(mass_count.keys())[i]) + \": \" + str(mass_count[keys[i]]))  What I've got #2 Everything as I want except one thing: There are all elements displaying from max to min on my first result but this order is violated on the second result. So I want: White: 22 Black: 14 Sky blue: 6 ... How can I achieve it? Thank you. "
