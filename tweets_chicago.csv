It‚Äôs one of those events, that once you see White Christmas and/or It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life in an old, small Chicago theatre that still has an organ with the place packed, you‚Äôd create an immediate tradition.  We go every year there‚Äôs not a pandemic."
11,paulghaynes50,"@theangriestbuni Absolutely correct.  That‚Äôs also one of the best scenes.  If you‚Äôre in Chicago, see it on the big screen at Music Box.  It‚Äôs a long lived tradition for many locals.  Very festive.  Sing along and have fun.  https://t.co/P4BKQFD7lg"
