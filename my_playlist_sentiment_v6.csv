He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

Let's talk this over, it's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hanging in a city so dead
Held up so high on such a breakable thread

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

You were everything, everything that I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
All of the memories so close to me just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking

And I've been wrong, I've been down
Into the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, ""Are we having fun yet?""

Rachel Bay Jones,782wocBbKLROLTSPViayHH,So Big / So Small,5M2LiZ8SmRFWl1IJ0F7JNR,"It was a February day
When your dad came by, before going away
A U-Haul truck in the driveway
The day it was suddenly real

I told you not to come outside
But you saw that truck
And you smiled so wide
A real live truck in your driveway
We let you sit behind the wheel

Goodbye, goodbye
Now it's just me and my little guy
And the house felt so big, and I felt so small
The house felt so big, and I felt so small

Cher Lloyd,4m4SfDVbF5wxrwEjDKgi4k,None Of My Business,2SPEg45ZaUFJCg9GwNmRvw,"Damn, I heard that you and her been having problems
She likes to fight, I guess you both have that in common
Started at the top and now you at the bottom
But baby, this is none of my business

You moved on, that a wrong, been a while, baby
So did I (so did I, so did I)
Took her home to your mom
Oh, but trust me that ain't on my mind
(On my mind, on my mind, on my mind)

I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I saw on my feed
She looks a little like me
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I can't help but see
It's not jealousy, no

Damn, I heard that you and her been having problems
She likes to fight, I guess you both have that in common
Started at the top, and now you at the bottom

But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything

Griff,5RJFJWYgtgWktosLrUDzff,Black Hole,6xw8ld1ztoCKifwTN6uGDq,"Now and then
Your name comes up in conversation with my friends
I hate how much I feel it right there in my chest
I hate how much I feel it, yeah

Like, how are you?
It seems like things are going really well for you
I wish that I could say the same about me too
I wish that I could say the same

And boy, you know I've tried to pray
I've bruised my knees
I've tried to bring you back to me
I've tried my best to find some kind of peace
Don't you see?

There's a big black hole where my heart used to be
And I tried my best to fill it up with things I don't need
It don't work like that, no, it's not easy
To fill this gap that you left in me

Mika Nakashima,3D73KNJRMbV45N59E8IN0F,僕が死のうと思ったのは,2NOIV90vZjJEzbKiJyGZiS,"僕が死のうと思ったのは
ウミネコが桟橋で鳴いたから
波の随意に浮かんで消える
過去も啄ばんで飛んでいけ

僕が死のうと思ったのは
誕生日に杏の花が咲いたから
その木漏れ日でうたた寝したら
虫の死骸と土になれるかな

薄荷飴 漁港の灯台 錆びたアーチ橋 捨てた自転車
木造の駅のストーブの前で
どこにも旅立てない心
今日はまるで昨日みたいだ
明日を変えるなら今日を変えなきゃ
分かってる 分かってる けれど

僕が死のうと思ったのは
心が空っぽになったから
