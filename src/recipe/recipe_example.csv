Optionally, you can broil the strata for a minute or two to brown the top.","Cook's Notes: If you want something a little eggier, a little more quiche-like, just simply increase the amount of egg custard used. As long as your pan is deep enough, you could as much as double the eggs and cream in this. This is a very rich dish, so you may want to cut the cream with milk. In fact, many people use all milk for this, but I do enjoy the extra butterfat the cream provides. As usual, let your conscience be your guide. You can used thawed, drained frozen spinach instead of fresh. You'll need enough to cover one layer. Instead of waiting for an hour to bake the prepared strata, you can bake it immediately or cover and refrigerate overnight and bake the next day.",Nutrition Facts Per Serving: 535 calories; protein 21.8g 44% DV; carbohydrates 23.5g 8% DV; fat 39.9g 61% DV; cholesterol 267.7mg 89% DV; sodium 1168.5mg 47% DV.

Cheesecake Filling:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened. cup white sugar. 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour. 2 eggs. 2 tablespoons lemon juice

Sauce:
1 cup water. 1 cup white sugar. cup honey. teaspoon vanilla extract","Step 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter the bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch pan. Advertisement.

Making the stollen is costly and time-consuming but well worth the effort.

1 cups water. teaspoon cream of tartar. 4 cups white sugar. 2 tablespoons lemon juice

For the Sponge:
cup milk, room temperature, divided. 1 (0.6 ounce) cakes cake yeast. 1 teaspoon white sugar. 1 cup unbleached flour

For the Dough:
3 cups unbleached flour. cup white sugar. 1 pinch salt. 2 eggs, room temperature. zest from 1 lemon. cup unsalted butter, room temperature and cut into chunks. cup ground almonds

For the Filling:
cup milk. 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature. cup white sugar. 2 cups poppy seeds. 1 teaspoons lemon zest. teaspoon ground cinnamon. 1 egg, room temperature","Step 1 First, make the fondant. It needs to be refrigerated overnight before using. To make the fondant, you'll need a marble slab or a baking sheet and an offset spatula to fold the candy. If you're using a baking sheet, rinse it with water, leaving a few drops on the pan. Advertisement. Step 2 Dissolve the cream of tarter in the water in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the sugar and bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Swirl the pan occasionally to help dissolve the sugar. Do not stir once the sugar syrup begins to boil. Heat to 240 degrees F (115 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.. Step 3 Immediately pour the candy onto the baking sheet or marble slab and let cool for 10 minutes. Use a spatula to vigorously knead the candy, folding it over itself. Knead until it begins to look cloudy, 5 to 10 minutes; allow it to cool. Transfer the fondant to a heatproof bowl or the top of a double boiler. Refrigerate overnight.. Step 4 To make the sponge, dissolve the yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in 1/4 cup of the room-temperature milk. Pour the remaining 1/2 cup milk into the bowl of a stand mixer. Add 1 cup of flour and the yeast mixture. Mix with a fork to combine. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow to rest until bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes.. Step 5 Stir the remaining 3 cups of flour, 1/4 cup sugar, salt, room-temperature eggs, and zest from 1 lemon into the sponge. Use the dough hook to mix the dough on the lowest setting. Mix the dough for about 5 minutes, occasionally scraping the dough off of the hook and down the sides of the bowl.. Step 6 Increase the speed to medium-low and add the softened butter 1 tablespoon at a time until fully incorporated. Allow the dough to mix for an additional 5 minutes, scraping the dough down as needed. Add the ground almonds and turn the mixer on for 1 or 2 turns, mixing just until incorporated. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and shape it into a ball. Place the ball in an oiled mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel and let it rise until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.. Step 7 While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Heat the milk in a heavy 4-quart saucepan until it begins to boil; stir in the butter and sugar. Remove the pan from the heat and add the poppyseeds, 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon zest, and the cinnamon. Let the mixture stand for 30 minutes to soften the poppyseeds. When the mixture is cool, whisk in the egg.. Step 8 Punch down the dough and roll it out into a 10 1/2- by 16-inch rectangle. Spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch margin on all sides. Roll the dough up into a log, starting with the long side, and pinch the edges together to form a seam. Place the loaf, seam-side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover it with greased plastic wrap or a well-floured kitchen towel and allow it to rise for an additional 30 to 40 minutes.. Step 9 Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).. Step 10 Bake the stollen until golden brown on the bottom of the loaf, about 40 minutes. Let the bread cool completely before glazing.. Step 11 To glaze the bread, add the lemon juice to the fondant. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula until soft and glossy. Pour the fondant over the stollen and allow it to cool before slicing.","Cook's Note You will need about half a pound of poppyseeds for the filling (2 1/2 cups). Editor's Notes Making fondant uses a technique similar to tempering chocolate: crystals develop as you fold it over itself while it cools. You'll need an offset spatula or a putty knife to knead the fondant. Reheat fondant in a double boiler just until fluid; if it gets too hot, it will lose its lustrous shine. If you'd rather skip the fondant topping, you can brush the stollen with melted butter and roll it in powdered sugar to coat it instead. You may substitute 1 1/2 envelopes (3 1/2 teaspoons) of active dry yeast in place of the cake yeast. Proof dry yeast in the milk before mixing the sponge.",Nutrition Facts Per Serving: 765 calories; protein 13.4g 27% DV; carbohydrates 116.9g 38% DV; fat 29.6g 46% DV; cholesterol 83.4mg 28% DV; sodium 37.8mg 2% DV.

A young person could make it with some parental guidance with the pineapple cutting and handling of the hot pan. This cake is not as sickeningly sweet as some pineapple upside-down cakes and not as greasy because less butter and brown sugar are used to prepare the pan. I use frozen cranberries or frozen pitted cherries instead of maraschino cherries, because I don't like the taste or artificial coloring of the maraschino cherries. But something red on the cake makes this one still look traditional.

It's rich and buttery like a brioche and needs time to firm up in the refrigerator.

1 cups unbleached all-purpose flour. teaspoon instant yeast. cup cool water. 1 cup golden raisins. cup Cointreau. cup chopped candied orange peel. cup chopped candied lemon peel

For the dough:
1 cup milk. teaspoon saffron threads. 2 eggs, room temperature. 2 cups bread flour. cup white sugar. 2 teaspoons instant yeast. 1 teaspoons salt. cup unsalted butter, room temperature and cut into chunks. 2 paper panettone forms. 1 egg. 1 tablespoon water. 2 tablespoons pearl sugar","Step 1 Prepare the sponge the night before you mix the dough: Mix 1.5 cups all-purpose flour with 1/8 teaspoon yeast in a bowl. Add 2/3 cup cool water. Cover with plastic wrap and let sponge stand at room temperature 8 hours to overnight. Advertisement. Step 2 Toss raisins with Cointreau in a bowl. Mix orange and lemon peel in with raisins and add an extra tablespoon of Cointreau and let them soften, if they are on the hard side. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand 8 hours to overnight.. Step 3 Pour milk into a saucepan and crumble in saffron threads; heat just to a simmer. Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer, taking care to get all of the saffron bits into the bowl. Let cool to just barely warm (110 degrees F) or room temperature.. Step 4 Transfer sponge to a mixing bowl, breaking up slightly with a spoon. Mix in eggs, stirring a few times by hand. Add 2 1/3 cups bread flour, sugar, 2 1/4 teaspoons yeast, and salt. Mix with the paddle attachment on low speed for about 5 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl occasionally; the dough will be very loose.. Step 5 Switch to the dough hook attachment and increase speed to medium. Add butter, one piece at a time, mixing until each piece is fully incorporated. Increase to high speed for 1 minute if the mixer can handle it; the dough should be climbing the dough hook and starting to clear the sides of the bowl. Add soaked raisins, orange peel, and lemon peel. Mix on low speed for 2 minutes; the fruit may not be fully dispersed.. Step 6 Transfer dough to a greased bowl. Flop the dough over itself a couple of times (it's a little too wet to fold), cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise for 60 minutes.. Step 7 Fold dough a few times to release gas and mix in fruit. Cover again with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.. Step 8 Turn the dough onto a floured work space. Divide in half and shape into 2 balls. Place each ball seam-side down in a 6"" paper panettone form and set on a baking sheet. Beat egg with water, and brush egg wash onto each loaf. Cover panettone forms loosely with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 90 minutes.. Step 9 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).. Step 10 Brush loaves with egg wash again and sprinkle pearl sugar on top.. Step 11 Place baking sheet in the hot oven, immediately reducing the temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake for 20 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet and bake for an additional 10 minutes.. Step 12 Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until a tester inserted in the center of each loaf comes out clean, about 20 minutes more. Cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.","Cook's Notes: I use SAF Gold instant yeast because it's been specially formulated for use in sweet rich doughs like this. It's sold in 1-pound packages and is available in specialty markets and online. If you rarely bake, use instant yeast packets or bread machine yeast. If you want to really make this from scratch, you can candy your own citrus peels. I buy organic oranges and lemons, blanching the orange peels 3 times and the lemon peels 4 or 5 times before adding them to the sugar syrup. Store candied peels in their syrups in the fridge for up to 6 weeks. Freshly candied citrus peels are nice and soft, so I don't soak them the night before; just add them to the dough in Step 4.",Nutrition Facts Per Serving: 181 calories; protein 3.9g 8% DV; carbohydrates 29.8g 10% DV; fat 5g 8% DV; cholesterol 32.4mg 11% DV; sodium 161.9mg 7% DV.
