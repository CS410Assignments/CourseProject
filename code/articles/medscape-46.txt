MCL was not recognized by  previous lymphoma classification schemes ; it was frequently categorized as diffuse small-cleaved cell lymphoma (by the International Working Formulation) or centrocytic lymphoma (by the Kiel classification). MCL is now recognized in the  World Health Organization  and  Revised European-American Lymphoma  classifications as a distinct clinicopathologic entity and represents 2%-10% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs).
