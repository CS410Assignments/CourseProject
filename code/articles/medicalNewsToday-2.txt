11/08/2021 11:33 GMT  England: COVID-19 admissions 14 times higher than they were this time last year
Speaking with Sky News about the situation in England, NHSChiefExecutive Amanda Pritchardsaid, We have had 14 times the number of people in hospital with COVID-19 than we saw this time last year. We also had a record number of [accident andemergency] attendance and a record number of [emergency] calls.
She continued, As we look into winter, I think were very clear this is going to be a difficult winter, and the things we encourage people to do is anything they can do to protect themselves, so thats the COVID-19 vaccine, its the flu vaccination in particular.
To address these concerns, people in England can now book their booster shots 1 month before they become eligible. This includes people over 50 years and anyone at increased risk of severe COVID-19.
However, some experts are concerned that the government is sending out mixed messages. According toDr. Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association Council:
I think this is a very confusing public health message from the government. Because on the one hand, its concerned about the level of infections and is really urging everyone to have the vaccine, but on the other hand, its telling people that they can actually mix freely, without any infection control measures, and they can actually mix without face coverings, without physical distancing, with crowding in indoor spaces.
11/05/2021 11:34 GMT  Study charts decline in vaccine protection over time
A recentstudyassessed vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and related death over time. The researchers found that, overall, protection against infection dropped from 87.9% to 48.1% between February and October 2021.
The decline was greatest for the Johnson and Johnson (J&J) vaccine, with effectiveness dropping to 13.1%.
Vaccinated people who developed the infection still had protection against fatal illness, but to a lesser extent. From July to October 2021, protection against death in people aged 65 or younger varied by vaccine:
The authors conclude that their Findings support continued efforts to increase vaccination, booster campaigns, and multiple, additional layers of protection against infection.
11/05/2021 11:31 GMT  Do vaccines protect better than infection-induced immunity?
A recent study compared the level of immunity afforded by a previous infection with the protection provided by a COVID-19 vaccine. The results suggest that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are around five times more effective at preventing hospitalization than a previous infection.

The decision came after CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P.Walensky endorsed the recommendation by a CDCadvisory committee.
We know millions of parents are eager to get their children vaccinated, and with this decision, we now have recommended that about 28 million children receive a COVID-19 vaccine, said Dr. Walensky.
More than8,300kids aged 511 have been hospitalized due to COVID-19 in the United States, with a third requiring intensive care.
As a mom, I encourage parents with questions to talk to their pediatrician, school nurse, or local pharmacist to learn more about the vaccine and the importance of getting their children vaccinated, Dr. Walensky added.
11/03/2021 09:36 GMT  Antidepressant cuts risk of COVID-19 hospitalization, death by 32%
An inexpensive and widely available antidepressant significantly reduces the risk of hospitalization and death forpeopleat high risk of severe COVID-19, aclinical trialhas found.
If taken early in the course ofa SARS-CoV-2infection, fluvoxamine may prevent the immune system from being hyperactivated,which can lead toa cytokine storm, a life threatening systemic inflammatory syndrome. Cytokine stormsoften developin severe COVID-19 cases and haveled tomanyfatalities.
Doctors have been using the drugto treat depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder for decades.

10/28/2021 09:32 GMT  Cost-effective antidepressant may help treat COVID-19
A recentanalysisshows that early treatment of COVID-19 with a low-cost antidepressant called fluvoxamine may reduce the risk of severe outcomes. According to the authors, among high risk participants, fluvoxamine reduced the risk of hospitalization, compared with people who took a placebo.
The data came from theTOGETHERtrial and included information from 741 people with COVID-19 who took fluvoxamine in an emergency care setting.
Co-principal investigator Dr. Edward Mills, of McMaster University, in Canada, explains why the results are important:
COVID-19 still poses a risk to individuals in countries with low resources and limited access to vaccinations. Identifying inexpensive, widely available, and effective therapies against COVID-19 is therefore of great importance, and repurposing existing medications that are widely available and have well-understood safety profiles is of particular interest.

A recentstudylooked for an association between the Johnson&Johnson COVID-19 vaccine andGuillain-Barr syndrome(GBS). The authors conclude that there may be a small but statistically significant safety concern for[GBS]following receipt of the [Johnson & Johnsonvaccine].
GBS is a rare but serious autoimmune neurologicalcondition. It can lead to weakness and paralysis that can last months or years.
To investigate potential links, the researchers took data from theVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This system is passive,meaning itrelies on members of the public reporting their experiences, rather than taking data from medical records.
As the authors of the study explain, the results must be considered preliminary pending analysis of medical records.
The researchers also write that it is usually not possible to verify causal associations between vaccines and adverse events from spontaneous reports to VAERS.
