July 28, 2021 -- Grimmway Farms of Bakersfield, CA, is voluntarily recalling several brands of
carrots
because of a possible
salmonella
contamination. The recalled carrots have the brand names Bunny Luv, Cal-Organic, Grimmway Farms, and O Organics and are sold at major retailers nationwide. These popular brands of carrots are being pulled from shelves after a routine, internal company test as a preventive measure, Jeff Huckaby, Grimmway Farms president and CEO, said in a statement. The company did not say if it discovered products contaminated with salmonella or if salmonella was discovered on machinery. The health of our customers and the integrity of our products are our highest priorities, and we will continue to monitor and communicate as additional information is available, the statement said. The company recalled six products, as well as certain shredded carrots and chopped (chunk) carrots that were sold to food manufacturers and food service distributors, the FDA says. The company has notified all customers who received the products directly from Grimmway Farms. All affected food manufacturers, food service distributors, and retail stores have been notified. Much of the recalled product was pulled before it reached shelves. No illnesses have been reported. Salmonella symptoms include
fever , diarrhea,
nausea , vomiting, and belly pain. But it can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.
