Just wanna rock you girl
I'll have whatever you have
Come on, just give it a whirl
See I've been watchin' you
And I like the way you move
So go ahead, girl, just do
That ass shakin' thing you do

So you grab your girls
And you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me
In the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right
So you pass to the left and you sail to the right

Don't be so quick to, walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body

Dance with me
Just let me rock you

I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me
You know what I want, and I got what you need

You look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you

You fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get, and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

For handing you a heart worth breaking

Been to the bottom of every bottle

Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah

Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

Children hurt, hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
Or would you turn the other cheek?

Call your name, two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling, and my pride is the one to blame (yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (hey)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now

Everyone's got their chains to break
Holding you

Were you born to resist or be abused?

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?

Are you gone and on to someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use

I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose

My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose

To drink these draining seconds

When I'm constantly failing you
Walls that we just can't break through

The Killers,0C0XlULifJtAgn6ZNCW2eu,Human,1sTsuZTdANkiFd7T34H3nb,"I did my best to notice
When the call came down the line
Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought, but I was kind
And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes
Clear your heart
Cut the cord

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance

No teasin', I need you to
Get up, up on the dance floor
Give that man what he askin' for (oh)

Shakira,0EmeFodog0BfCgMzAIvKQp,"Whenever, Wherever",2lnzGkdtDj5mtlcOW2yRtG,"Lucky you were born that far away so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence

Baby, I would climb the Andes solely
To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody

Le-do-lo-le-lo-le, le-do-lo-le-lo-le
Can't you see? I'm at your feet

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there, and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
There over, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear

And I look across the water

And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

'Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Won't you come on over
Stop makin' a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie

Valerie, Valerie, Valerie

Did you have to go to jail
Put your house on up for sale

To see the show tonight
And there's a light on
Heavy glow

By the way I tried to say
I'll be there
Waiting for

Dani the girl
Is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee
Overload

Steak-knife
Card shark
Con job
Boot cut

Skin that flick
She's such a little DJ
Get there quick
By street but not the freeway

Turn that trick
To make a little leeway
Beat that nic
But not the way that we play

Dog town
Blood bath
Rib cage
Soft tail

Standing in line
To see the show tonight
And there's a light on
Heavy glow

Hey

Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, ooh
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground found somethin' true
And everyone's looking 'round thinking I'm going crazy, ooh I

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud

Walk out the house with my swagger
Hop in the whip yo I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, out of control
Just like my mind where I'm going
No women, no shorties, no nothing my clothes
No stomping on my Perreli's on froze
Unlike my jewelry that's always on cold
I know the storm is coming

My pockets keep telling me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies it's on and poppin' tonight 'cause it's meant to be ours
We keep a fade away shot 'cause we balling this platinum patron every hour
Look momma I owe you just like the flowers
Girl you the truth with all that goody sour

When you go down, when you go down, down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down

Well, I know this little chapel on the boulevard we can go
No one will know, oh, come on girl
Who cares if we're trashed, got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of patron and it's on, girl

Don't say no, no, no, no, no

When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road

The one you sold to fool the world
You lost your self esteem along the way, yeah

Good god, you're coming up with reasons
Good god, you're dragging it out
Good god, it's the changing of the seasons
I feel so raped, so follow me down

Just fake it if you're out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong here
Fake it if you feel like infection
Whoa, you're such a fucking hypocrite

You should know that the lies won't hide your flaws
No sense in hiding all of yours
You gave up on your dreams along the way, yeah

Don't like the back seat, gotta be first (oh-oh)
I'm like the ring leader, I call the shots (call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot

When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All eyes on me in the center of the ring just like a circus
When I crack that whip everybody gon' trip just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me, show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor just like a circus

Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
