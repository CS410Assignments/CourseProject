Cybersecurity is fundamental to securing modern services
in the 21st century. This non-technical course,
Cybersecurity for Everyone, will help you understand
foundational concepts of the ever-changing
cyber landscape and how we can
think strategically about protecting our
critical services and data. Hi, I'm Dr. Charles Harry, Associate Research Professor and Director of Operations at Maryland Global Initiative
for Cybersecurity at the University of Maryland. From supporting sensitive
cyber operations, to years spent consulting
with top enterprises, I'm excited to help you from the professional to
the uninitiated, demystify cybersecurity, and think about how we can
effectively manage threats. Please join me for
Cybersecurity for Everyone.
