Hi. Welcome back to
cybersecurity for everyone. I'm Dr. Charles [inaudible]. In this episode, I want to talk about the next two phases, the hacking process,
exploitation and installation. If you recall,
hacking is a process, it's not a single activity. In fact, it's a grouping
of several activities altogether that strong together create what is called a hack. In this particular episode, I want to talk about
two specific phases, exploitation and installation. Once we've reached our target, remember we've now
delivered our exploit. We've delivered that exploit to target through a variety of different means and
those could include everything from sending
a direct email, which we call spear fish, direct message through
social media, a USB drive, even compromising
a webpage or even having direct to access
to the machine itself. The hacker is now poised
to exploit the device. The exploitation is attempted against that device that
you're now in contact with. If successful, malware is
installed, bad software. We'll come back to
that in a minute. Let's first talk
about exploitation. Well, this is when the user
and the user system is directly interacting with the malicious exploit code
that we've developed. That usually means
something like clicking on a link or opening a
particular document. Now, there are other
ways to exploit devices. We're not going to
talk about those right now in this course, but it's good enough to know
that what we're talking about is interacting
with the exploit code. The system, for example, a web browser, is now
exposed to the exploit code. If successful, a
connection is now made back to the threat
actors infrastructure. That provides threat actor direct to access to the system. Now, at this point they
haven't installed anything. They haven't installed
their own software. They've simply exploited
the device and created a direct connection
back to their infrastructure. Let's take look at an example. The Advanced Persistent Threat Group or APT Group, Ocean Lotus, it's a Vietnamese
hacking organization, used Microsoft Word documents as a way to try to
entice individuals. These are called
oftentimes lure files, like a fishing lure. The idea is to try to entice
users to click and open them to execute that
actual exploit code that's embedded in the document. The documents are oftentimes drafted to make it look
enticing to the user. Imagine you are an employee in an organization
and you get an email, and there's an attachment and
language in the email that talks about this is the breakdown of all
employee salaries. You might actually be somewhat inclined and a little
bit curious to see how much Bob is making down the hall. You might click on it. Once executed, a connection is made back to Ocean
Lotus' infrastructure. Now, we're not going to go
into a deep detail about that infrastructure and
that specific set of hacks. It's good enough to understand that when you interact
with the exploit code, it creates a connection back to the threat actors
infrastructure. Let's talk about installation. We've exploited the device. The device that is
successfully exploited through some specific
vulnerability that we've identified during the
weaponization phase, now allows that threat
actor to install software. We call this malware. These are programs
that have been created by the threat actor
that help facilitate additional actions on target
to and include moving around to other computers
in the impacted network. Threat actors will use a
range of different techniques to persistently maintain
access to the device. Here are a couple of
different examples. They can hook into
existing processes. Processes that run on a normal basis
that boot up every time your computer boots up, they're going to hook into that. It's a way to constantly
keep their malware running. They can create
an administrative accounts that allow them to log in at anytime they need to. They can modify the
loading order a very specific files called DLL files, to enable their malware every single time the
computer boots up. What are some of the takeaways? Well, hacking again
is a process, I keep reiterating this. The fourth phase is
called exploitation. Now, exploitation is when
the threat actor's code is executed on the target's device and creates a connection back
to their infrastructure. The fifth phase of the hacking process is
called the installation. I've now successfully exploited a device and now I'm actually
installing my software. That software is also
known as malware. In our next episode, we're going to talk about
command and control, how threat actors
actually maintain access to these compromised devices. I hope to see you next time.
