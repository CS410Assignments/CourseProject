In 1789 philosopher and professor of Law, Jeremy
Bentham, famously argued that it was the ability to suffer and not the ability to reason or
to talk that should be the benchmark for decisions relating to how we treat animals. Welcome
to the Animal Behaviour and Welfare course My name is Professor Nat Waran and I am the Director
of the Jeanne Marchig International Centre for Animal Welfare Education at the University
of Edinburgh's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary studies, here in bonnie Scotland. Whilst the
idea that animals such as Peanut and Bella, here, might not have feelings seems nonsensical
to most people, we have to appreciate that it is only relatively recently become accepted
that animals are sentient and therefore feel things like pain and fear and stress as well
as more positive emotions like happiness and pleasure, all of which are important for their
welfare. Animals play a huge part in the lives of many people and although we rely on them
for all aspects of our well-being, for food, draft power, medical advances, clothing, sport,
as well as for pleasure, companionship, protection and comfort, often their quality of life is
questionable. By the end of this course we would have gone well beyond those early scientists and philosophers who believed that animals like Latchino were like machines and we would
have explored why animal welfare is so internationally, politically and socially important and how
enlighting a scientific approach to the study of animal welfare can be.
We look forward to welcoming you to the course.
