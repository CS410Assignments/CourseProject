In this week's course, we suggest you
start with the interactive session on the production cycle of animals, as this will go through how farm
animals are actually produced and where the likely welfare challenges
happen during the production cycle. If you're more used to farm animals,
you might want to skip that section. Otherwise, there are three lectures. One by myself on dairy cows,
one by my colleague Susan Jarvis on pigs, and another by my colleagues from
the Aviation Research Center on poultry. Finally, there is another interactive
session on live animal transport, and we suggest you leave that until
after you've watched the lectures. At the end of the week, you might want to
do the quizzes to test your knowledge, start to ask questions on
the discussion board, and join us in the Google Hangouts to see us answer
your most frequently asked questions.
