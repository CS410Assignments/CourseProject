Here in the UK, we consider dogs and
cats very much to be companion animals. There are pets and dogs like Moffy and Matilda here are very
much part of my family. But are dogs and cats really the only
animals which are capable of that level of connection with people? We consider cattle, sheep and
pigs to be very much production animals, animals that we use for food. Why should dogs and cats be any different? Are dogs and cats more sentient
than cattle, sheep and pigs? We know that they have a similar
ability to feel emotional states and to feel states such as pain or fear. So really how do we distinguish,
in terms of welfare science, the differences between the farming
of dogs and cats for food and the farming of other species for food. Are those other species any
less worthy of our care? When we look at how we farm animals, the
systems that we use for production, for transport, and for slaughter, we can see that they may not be
suited to carnivores like dogs and cats. These animals have sharp teeth and
claws and can respond very aggressively to humans
if they're frightened or stressed. We also know that dogs and cats
are carnivores and require a high quality, high protein diet that can be difficult
to deliver in an economical way. And so, it may mean that their nutritional
needs are not met through farming. They're difficult to house
together in large numbers without aggression occurring. And it can be difficult
to transport them and slaughter them in a matter that is humane. All of these things contrast with
how we farm livestock species. And so when we're considering the welfare
and ethics of dog and cat farming, we need to consider not just our own
emotional response to this industry, which to us might seem quite alien,
but actually the welfare state of the animals that might get through it,
and by extent, the welfare state of other animals that we use for farming and
how we should treat those animals too.
