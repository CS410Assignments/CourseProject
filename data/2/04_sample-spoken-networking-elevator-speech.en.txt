While attending a professional conference
in another city, imagine that you've just
arrived at a social event with many people who work in
the same industry as you, medicine, engineering,
education, etc. While you are learning about
new things in your field, you are also meeting new people who work
in the same industry. These people work for
other companies or organizations and they may
know about available jobs. Whenever you meet new people
in a professional setting, it is important that you have a short description that you can use to introduce
yourself to others. We've looked at things to say in a networking elevator
speech and how to stress certain words and pause
in specific places. Now, it is your
chance to try it out. Hello. My name is Robyn
Turner and I've been an English language
instructor for over 15 years. I taught English in many
different programs in Japan, Bulgaria, and New York. I'm looking to work with other instructors to help
build online courses. I've really enjoyed working with international students because I learned so much about different people,
places, and cultures. One of my best skills is being flexible and willing
to try new things.
