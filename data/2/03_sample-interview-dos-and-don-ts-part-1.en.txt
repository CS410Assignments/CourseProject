Hello, in this and the next and
final video in our course, we're going to look at some of
the do's and don'ts of an interview. We will look at what are acceptable
things to see and hear in an interview in the United States, and what
are unacceptable things to see and hear. By the end of these two videos you
should have a clear understanding of what a good interview should look and
sound like. Let's get started. We're going to begin, by looking
at the beginning of an interview. This is when the interviewee
will first meet the interviewer. And perhaps, make some small talk
before the actual interview begins. As you watch ask yourself the question, is this interviewee making
a good first impression? Why or why not? After the scene we'll come back and
discuss your answers. >> [SOUND]. >> Come in. >> [SOUND]. >> Come in. >> Am I in the right place for
the job interview? >> Are you Michael Flatly? >> The last time I checked I was. >> Sorry? >> I'm sorry, I'm Michael Flatly. I'm really sorry I'm late the train
took forever getting here. Public transportation in this
city I hate it may I sit? >> Sure. >> I hope you agree that this was not
the greatest of starts to an interview. First, the interviewee was late. Which is not something you
should ever be for an interview. Then he came dressed unprofessionally. Finally, his manner was too informal,
and casual, for a professional situation,
like, an interview. Let's try that once again, shall we? Again, ask yourself if this candidate
is making a good first impression? >> [SOUND]
>> Come in. >> Hi, Ms. Hernandez? >> Yes, are you Michael Flatley? >> That's right, I hope I'm not too early. >> Not at all, it's very nice to meet you. >> Nice to meet you too. >> Did you have any trouble
finding the building? >> No, not at all, thank you. >> Please have a seat and
we'll get started. >> Great. >> Much better, I think you'll agree. No lateness, no unprofessional dress, no informal manner, so far so good. I hope you'll agree that this candidate
has made a good first impression. In this video, we've looked at
the beginning of an interview. The moment you walk in the door to
the moment that questions begin. In the next video we'll look at the remainder of the interview and look at some more do's and dont's.
