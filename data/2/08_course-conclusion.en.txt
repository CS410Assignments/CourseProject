Hi and
welcome to the final video in our course. >> As we said in the first video, this course was designed to help you
improve your English language skills and your understanding of
the job application process. We hope you have learned a lot from the
experience and now feel better prepared and more confident finding and
applying for jobs you are interested in. >> For many of you, your job search will not simply
end as soon as this course does. As we mentioned before,
many of us change jobs and careers throughout our working lives. On each occasion, we may have to go through the different
steps we have discussed in this course. We hope you will learn and
grow from each experience. >> Please remember the importance
of preparing an up to date professional looking resume and
cover letter. Making a good first impression
with an employer is vital. In addition, prepare for the job
interview by researching the company and being ready to answer
typical interview questions. >> We really enjoyed working with you and we wish you all the best in your
future studies and careers. Good luck.
