Hi again. In this, the final video of our course, we're going to look at some more do's and
don'ts of an interview. We'll compare what is appropriate and
correct with what is not appropriate or correct in an interview
in the United States. When we left our interview
in the last video, we saw that the questioning part of
the interview was about to begin. The candidate hadn't made
a good first impression. He's arrived late, was unprofessional
dressed and had an informal manner. Let's continue with the interview and
see how he does answering the questions. As you watch ask yourself these questions,
one, does he answer the questions well? Two, when he doesn't
understand a question, does he use a clarification question well? And three, does the interviewee have
good questions of his own prepared? Ready? Back to our interview. >> Michael, you just told me
about your biggest strength, what would you say is
your biggest weakness? >> Good question, to be honest,
I don't really have any weaknesses. >> Okay. Well then, could you tell me why
you want to work for this company? >> Well, I hadn't really heard of
this company until I heard it from a friend of mine who has this
ex-girlfriend who used to work here. But I hear the pay is good and
the restaurant food is awesome. >> Okay. Well where do you see
yourself in three years? >> What's that? >> In the future,
where do you see yourself in three years? >> Probably in your job. [LAUGH]
>> All right then. I've asked you a few questions. Do you have any questions for me? >> Yeah, how much vacation
time will I get in this job? >> Ok, in this position you would normally
get two days of vacation per month. So, at the end of the year
that would be 24 days. >> 24 days? Awesome, when can I start? >> We'll get back to you soon. >> Well, what do you think? I hope you can agree that this
interviewee did most of the things you shouldn't do in an interview. He didn't answer the questions well. He used clarifying questions incorrectly. And he didn't have any good questions
prepared for the interviewer. Overall, this was a disaster. I am pretty sure this person
will not be getting the job. Let's now turn to the other candidate. When we last saw him, he had made a good
first impression by being on time. Being professionally dressed and
having a professional manner. Good job so far. Let's see how he does
answering the questions. >> Michael, you just told me
about your biggest strength, what would you say is
your biggest weakness? >> That's a good question. Let me think, probably I take
criticism a little too personal. But, this is something I'm really working
on and trying not to let criticism I've see it as being personal but
more professional thing. Am I making sense here? >> Yes, absolutely. And so, why do you want to work for
this company? Well, I really like the set of products
that this company has developed and I think with my own experience
in the set of skills that I've developed that I can really contribute and
help this company grow. >> Okay, so
where do you see yourself in three years? >> If I'm understanding you correctly, you're asking me where do I see
myself in three years time. Is that right? >> Yes, that's correct. >> Well, probably in the same role or
maybe in a more senior position. Maybe growing into a position with more
responsibility, maybe managing a team. >> Okay, great,
I have asked you a few questions. Do you have any questions for me? >> Yeah, sure do. Are there any opportunities for
professional development in this position? >> Great question. We do have a budget for training and a lot of our employees use
that money to take courses. But we also offer in-house professional
development a few times a year. >> That sounds like
a wonderful opportunity. Great, I can't wait to start. >> All right, well we have a few
more candidates to interview but then we will be getting
back to you very soon. >> Okay, wonderful, thank you. >> Pretty impressive responses,
I hope you agree. He was well prepared and
answered the questions confidently. I hope this candidate
gets offered the job or at least gets called for
a second interview. What do you think? In this video we looked at some of
the do's and don'ts of an interview. We compared what's appropriate,
and what's not appropriate. Next, we'll play a game where you'll
match sample answers to questions. And finally,
we'll get started on our unit assessment.
