Hello, and welcome
to our company. I'm glad you could come to
talk about the job opening, I've read your resume and I have a few questions that I'd
like to ask you about your skills and past experience. First, I'd like to know a
little bit more about you. I wonder if you could tell me
about a time when you faced a challenge and what you did
to overcome that challenge? Well, after my husband
and I moved to California and our children
started school there, I decided that I wanted to get my master's degree in English, lots of reading and
papers to write. As you can imagine, this was a real challenge, taking care of my children, taking classes, and working
in my husband's business. But I'm a very
determined person and luckily my family was
very supportive of me, so I could take classes in
the evenings and on weekends. Of course I didn't sleep very
much for about three years, and sometimes I missed
spending time on the weekends with my
family but I kept going. My family was so proud, and I was proud when I finally
got my master's degree.
