Hello, in this video, we're going to
talk about some useful words and phrases that you'll hear many times
throughout the job search process. We will organize these words into three
categories, things, actions, and people. Lets begin with important definition
of things, or general concepts. Occupation and career. An occupation is like a job
because both are very specific. For example,
being a waiter is a job or occupation. If Tom works as a waiter, a bartender,
and a restaurant manager over 20 years, he can say that he has a career
in the restaurant industry. An occupation is a person's
work as a way to earn money. A career is an occupation or a profession
that requires special training and continues over a long period of time. Here's another example, Yuki has worked for
the clothing company UNIQLO for ten years. She began her career in the fashion
industry with different occupations, first as a sales clerk,
then as a store manager. Now, she works at the company's
main office as a fashion designer. Let's look at two more
definitions of things. Employment is a general term for
the activity that people do to make money. When someone asks you about your
employment history, focus on work for which you were paid money. A job application is a written request for
employment, usually a specific
document to be completed. In the job search process,
there are some actions, or verbs, that are very important. Let's look at five of these. The first is to search for
a job, this means to look for work in a specific occupation. To apply for a job is to formally ask for
employment, usually in writing. This means completing
a specific job application or sending a documents like a resume and
cover letter. We will talk more about these
later in units two and three. To interview for a job is to answer
question in a formal meeting. Most interviews are face to face but sometimes people can interview by phone or
video calls. To be hired for a job, is to be given
a job and then paid for the work. If someone says you're hired,
that means you got the job. To work is to do an activity
related to one's occupation. Now, let's move on to people. A job seeker is someone who is looking for
a job. After a person applies for
a job they become a candidate or an applicant which is a person
who might get the job. These next two words sound almost the same
but have very different meanings. Pay attention to the ending sounds of
these two words, employer and employee. An employer is the person making
the decision to give the applicant a job. The employer can be a specific person or
can also be a company or organization. When a candidate is hired and begins
working, he is then called an employee. Employee is a more formal word for worker. By now you probably noticed many of
this few vocabulary words look similar. But they are actually different
word forms, nouns and verbs. One way to help remember all of this
new words is to organize them into three categories. Things are nouns, actions are verbs and
people are nouns. Let's move on to a game where you
can practice grouping the words into the correct category. Things, actions or people.
