Hello, and welcome to the
science of happiness. I'm Professor Laurie Santos, a Professor in Psychology
and Cognitive Science, and I'm excited that
you're going to join me on this journey to learn a
little bit about the science, and also the practice
of well-being. I started these lectures here in Silliman College,
right here in my home, to introduce a small set of students to the
science of psychology. We thought that it might be so beneficial to Yale students, we wanted to bring it
to a bigger group, and that's where you come in. You get a chance to watch these short lectures on
the science of happiness, but also to think
about how to develop these practices in your own
life. We hope you enjoy it.
