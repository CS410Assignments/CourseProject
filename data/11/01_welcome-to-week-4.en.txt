Welcome to week four of your final rewirement challenge. You're finally on the homestretch. Congratulations on making it this far. Right now, let's take a second to pause and think about how much progress you've made so far. Hopefully, the rewirement you chose to do is starting to feel a little bit more automatic and that's the goal. We really want that your rewirement that you chose, to become deeply ingrained in your routine so you can continue doing that rewirement even when the course is over. This week, we have one more pro-tip for you. This week's pro-tip is to keep a growth mindset. In class, we learned about a growth mindset. This idea that you can continue getting better over time to not focus on your performance but on how much you're learning. We want you to keep going with week four, thinking in terms of a growth mindset. How much are you improving over time? What else can you do to make this rewirement a real part of your life? At the end of the week, we'll measure your happiness and compare that to the measurement you took at the beginning of the course. You're on the homestretch. You can make it. We'll see you at the end of the week.
