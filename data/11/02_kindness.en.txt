In this activity, we're going to focus on kindness,
the simple act of doing something nice. Why are we focusing on kindness? Well as we saw in lecture, the simple
act of doing a random act of kindness, can come with a host of positive benefits. Doing nice stuff for
others can increase our mood, and it can also increase our
feelings of social connection. How do you make the most of this activity? Well, you just gotta nice stuff for
people. Try to do at least one random
active kindness a day, it could be something big like donating
money or volunteering in your community. Or it can be something small like
giving somebody a compliment or just doing something nice. As usual,
we want you to track what you did, so get out there and do something nice, it'll
make you feel better than you expect.
