In this activity, we're going to focus on exercise. Why exercise? Well, it turns out that moving a little bit more can have a host of positive benefits. Getting some exercise in can increase your mood. It can even decrease depression symptoms as much as an anti-depression medication like Zoloft. We've also seen in lecture that exercise can increase your academic performance. It's a totally free and super easy way to make your life happier and healthier. So how do we make the most of this activity? You don't need to get out there and run a marathon. You just need to move a little bit more. Maybe hit the gym for a half hour or take a walk with a friend at lunch. You can even just dance around your living room. The goal is to move a bit more and then to track what you do in this exercise activity. Again, tracking the habits that we do can help turn the healthy practices we do one day into a long term habit. So get out there and move a little bit more. You'll end up becoming happier and healthier.
