Congratulations. You have completed your final rewirement challenge. You've also made it a whole month where you're focusing on improving your habits and having a better life. So now is the time to complete it. Now's the time to write and submit your peer review writing assignment. When drafting your response to these prompts, just try to be honest. Try to be as complete as possible in your answer. The rubric isn't looking for anything in particular. There's no right or wrong answers. We just want to see that you've answered truthfully and that you've learned something. When grading your peers, keep these same tips in mind. Really we just want you to grade based on the effort that your peers put into the project. All of you have a lot to be proud of and we hope that you've learned not just some new scientific insights, but that you've taken those insights to heart. That you've tried to rewire your behavior to be a little bit healthier and happier. At this point you've learned everything that the science of psychology has to say about how to live a better life and now it's up to you. We really want you to put these tips into practice in your own life beyond the course. So go for it. We know you can do it. Congratulations on completing the course.
