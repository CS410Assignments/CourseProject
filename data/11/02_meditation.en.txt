In this activity, we're going to focus on meditation. Why meditation? Well, as we saw in class, a wandering mind is an unhappy mind. Through the process of meditation, we can curb our mind wandering. We can just be in the present moment. Meditation also has a host of other positive benefits. It can increase our mood, and it can do so in just a couple of weeks. It also decreases our stress, and it can even boost our grey matter. So how do you make the most of this meditation activity? Well, if you're new to meditation, just try it out. Do it for about five minutes a day. If you've meditated before, try to increase the amount of time you spend in meditation. And as usual, track it. By tracking our meditation over time, we can turn a little bit of meditation into a long term habit. So get out there and try some meditation. It will make you a little bit more zen and maybe a lot happier.
