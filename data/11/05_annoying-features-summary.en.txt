That we have all these kind of funny features of our mind that deliver to us this swarm of miswanting. This idea that we're not wanting the right stuff. The first one, as we saw, of these annoying features is that we're constantly getting delivered misinformation. It's just a feature of our mind that sometimes our mind tells us very strongly this information is just false. It's the crux of miswanting. But we need to realize this annoying feature, to believe that miswanting really happens. Then we saw some of the other things that deliver this miswanting on those particular things. We don't think in terms of absolutes, we're constantly comparing ourselves to reference points, and we don't have control over what those reference points are, they just kind of pop in. Let's keep going in case this came to me and not the screen I think. The next one is that we are constantly seeing this annoying feature where our minds get used to stuff, where if we have something for a long period of time, it just becomes rote, and we stop getting the pleasure from it over and over again. And the worst thing is that we don't realize that that happens. We don't realize that that happens for the good stuff. That the good stuff's not going to make us as happy as we think. So, we're constantly like seeking out stuff, and feeling that we didn't get it because we don't get more. And we also don't kind of take on potentially bad things thinking like, that's just going to destroy me, when it's really not. So, the big question we're going to end with today is, okay, you just told me about all these annoying features in my mind. How do I shut them off? How do I make those things go away? What are the habits that I can put into place to overcome those annoying features? For that, you're going to have to wait till next time.
