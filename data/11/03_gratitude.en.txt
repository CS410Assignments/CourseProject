In this activity,
we're going to focus on gratitude. Why gratitude? Well as we saw in lecture, the simple act of experiencing gratitude
has a host of positive benefits. Experiencing gratitude can increase
your mood and lower your stress levels. It can even strengthen your immune
system and lower your blood pressure. Experiencing gratitude also can make
you feel a stronger social connection, which itself has this whole
host of positive benefits. And so
how do we make the most of this activity? Well if you're new to this habit, just start by writing things
down that you're grateful for. You can also use the app to take
a picture of the kinds of things you're thankful for. As you write and take your photos, really take a moment to try to experience
the gratitude you're thinking about. And as usual, do it over time. Use the app to make it happen. So get out there and feel some things for all the wonderful
things in your community and in your life.
