Okay, with that, we will wind down. And so, reviewing. What have we seen so far? Well we saw all the stuff we think is going to make us happy and healthy that we continue to invest in, unless we take in that intentional effort to not do that, doesn't make us as happy as we think. We saw why that was. It's because we seem to miswant these things, and we miswant these things because of these annoying features of our mind that mess us up. We get used to stuff, we don't seem to set our reference points correctly, all this stuff. And so, what can we do about this? Well, there are intentional strategies that we can use to break those biases, to break our reference points, to stop getting used to stuff, to break our hedonic adaptation. And we said, there are also things that we can do to tell ourselves that we're miswanting things. There's stuff that we should be wanting, that we're delivered this answer that we don't necessarily want very much, but we should want in general. And we went through those, these ways to want stuff that we do want, but we don't want the right parts like how to really pick jobs and learning outcomes that we dig. And then, we saw this final set of wanting. These things, we don't realize we want, but we should put into practice. All of these five things that if we put into practice more often, if we didn't have the opportunity cost of using these things, the other stuff, we would actually be happy. And then, we ended with two strategies that we can use to kind of go beyond just knowing the stuff that actually put those things into practice. So, setting up the right situations, and maybe really thinking about specific goals that you can start tonight, and thinking about specific goals in a very specific way. And so, with that, we're going to wind down. But I wanted to give you a set of homework for this time, which is a little bit more engaging than the homeworks last time, which is, most of you are taking this course not just because you wanted to learn about the science of psychology and to hear this stuff. You're not taking this course because you want to know this stuff. You're taking this course because you wanted to put this stuff into practice, and probably, you wanted to be happier, and increase your own personal well-being. And so, this is the challenge. Are you guys actually ready to do this? And so, the challenge is that I want to see, which of these strategies you want to put into practice. So, which of these spots of these things that you don't necessarily want that you should be wanting more that you can actually put into your life, so that you're doing them more often, using these techniques and strategies we learned about at the end, and sort of using these techniques and strategies we learned about the beginning to kind of get rid of your biases, to kind of curb them. And the goal and what we're going to see if you guys want to do now is to see if some of you would be game to commit for the next four weeks to do some of these things. It doesn't have to be a lot of them. In fact, the more you focus on one particular goal, the better. If you just picked one of these things that you wanted to do more of and just focused on that, use those techniques explicitly, that would actually be better. If you're game for that, what we will do is we will come back and we will meet here in four weeks' time. And the hope is that we will all have achieved this stuff. We'll have check-ins, and we'll have the social support of our situation, and I'll kind of ping you guys and remind you about your goals, and so on. And then, we'll come back here and see how it went. And at the end of that, we will also return to what we started before, which is that I'm going to want you guys to measure your happiness. Hopefully, most of you guys took the happiness survey before and we will revisit it four weeks on to see, did you guys do these things, and is it actually making a difference in terms of your authentic happiness score.
