Congratulations on finishing all of the lectures. I hope that you've learned a lot about the science of well-being over the course of these lectures and also have gotten some glimpses about how to put that science into practice in your own life. And so, now what? You've watched all the lectures. You've learned about what you should be doing. Is that enough? Well, if you've been paying attention to the lectures, I think you've seen that, in fact, sadly, it's not really enough. To really put the science of happiness into practice, you have to do some intentional work. And we hope you will continue doing that intentional work now that the videos have ended because this is the time that the real work starts. We hope you'll continue using the Rewi app. Keep tracking things like gratitude and happiness and sleep. As you've seen, the research suggests that that's the kind of thing that's going to increase your happiness over time. And so, I send you off to do the real work that will continue to increase your happiness and your well-being. Continue to keep doing these practices and put the science that you've learned into effect in your own life. I wish you luck on that journey. Thanks for being a part of the course.
