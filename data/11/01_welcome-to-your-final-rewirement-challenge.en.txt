Welcome to your final rewirement challenge. The rewirement challenge is the final project for this class and our goal is to let you apply what you learned in class to your everyday life. When we started class I told you that I wanted to do two things with this Coursera course. I wanted you to learn about the science of well-being, but I also wanted you to put that science into practice. Remember the G.I. Joe fallacy we learned about in class, that knowing is not half the battle? That means that to actually see personal changes from taking this class, you need to put in the work, you need to put in the time needed to really rewire your bad habits and strategies. And that's why we build that time into the course. By making this final rewirement challenge an assignment for you to complete the course, you are more likely to actually make the changes that you really want to see in your life. You're also able to marshal the social support of these thousands of learners, who are going to be doing this rewirement challenge with you. This assignment is our way of nudging you into all the behavioral changes that you've wanted to make for a while, but you haven't had the time to put in yet. For the final rewirement challenge, we're going to ask you to do a few things. First, we're going to ask you to pick a rewirement that you want to stick to for four whole weeks. We're also going to ask you to reflect on that rewirement and how it's going through several short writing prompts. Finally, we're going to ask you how your happiness has fared. I really hope you'll enjoy this rewirement challenge and I look forward to seeing your progress.
