Welcome to your second week of the Final Requirement Challenge. How did Week One go? Let's take a moment to really think about it. We'll pause the video here. If you did your rewirements every single time you planned to, congratulations. That's fantastic progress. If you missed a few times, that's okay too. As we've seen in the class, changing behavior is really hard. Building better habits isn't an all or nothing process. It's okay to mess up every now and again. Let's consider week two, a really fresh start. And as part of that fresh start, I'm going to give you another Pro-Tip. This week's pro-tip, is to socially commit. Tell somebody about the change you're trying to make. Share with a friend or with one of your fellow learners in the discussion forums. You should try as much as possible to make this social. Ask a friend to do a rewirement with you, or tell somebody you really care about to boost your accountability and increase the likelihood that you'll stick to this new routine. Good luck this week, I can't wait to see you for Week Three.
