Welcome to week three of your final rewirement challenge. You're halfway through. How did it go last week? Again, let's pause for a second just to reflect. If you hit your target, well-done. If you didn't, also perfectly fine. Full disclosure, I also struggled to stick to all of these things, and I'm the professor teaching the class, and that's why we need to reflect on some of the obstacles that might be getting in our way. What could you do better this week? One thing you could do is to follow this week's pro-tip. This week's pro-tip: design your environment. Remember what we learned in class about harnessing the situation to do a little bit better? How can you harness your situation to promote good environments and fix the bad ones that might be getting in the way? Think a little bit about how you can design your spaces to promote your success. Good luck.
