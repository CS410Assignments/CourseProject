In this activity, we're going to focus
on sleep and getting enough sleep. Why are we spending
time focusing on sleep? Well, as you saw in the lectures, the act
of getting enough sleep every night can have a host of positive benefits. We know that making sure you get enough
sleep can increase your mood over time. It can also increase your
cognitive performance, like doing well on tests and so on. Getting enough sleep also has
a host of other health benefits. It can decrease your risk of heart
disease, diabetes and even cancer. It's a totally free and super easy way
to boost your mood and your health. And so
how do you make the most of this activity? It's pretty simple,
you just gotta get some sleep. Try to shoot for
around 7 to 8 hours a night and when you do track your
sleep in the ReWi app. As we saw in lecture,
tracking your sleep over time can help turn getting a healthy
amount of sleep into a habit. And so go out there and get some z's on. You'll be happier and even healthier.
