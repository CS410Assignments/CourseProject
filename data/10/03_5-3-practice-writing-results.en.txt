In this next module,
we're going to do some active practice, editing a paragraph
from a results section. This table is from a paper I
was editing for a student, about running during pregnancy. I'm showing you some relevant
snippets from table two. This paper was concerned with, what percent of runners continue running
during pregnancy and breast feeding? And how much and how hard they run? Here is the original
draft of the paragraph of the results section that
corresponded to that table. I am going to ask you in
a minute to pause the video, and edit that paragraph on your own. Keeping in mind, that since this table
contains the main results of the study, it's okay to leave some key numbers in. But you have to pick and choose. So now go ahead and pause the video,
and edit the exercise, and then restart the video, and
I will walk you through my edits. Okay, hopefully you noticed
that the author here is just reading the table for you. Hopefully, you also noticed
the repetition and wordiness in the pros. I'm going to go through and
edit this line by line. Now I picked out certain
statistics to highlight that I thought were the most interesting and
most important to this analysis. It's fine if you chose to
highlight different statistics, as long as you sufficiently
paired the paragraph down. There are actually many
possible ways to edit this. So starting with that first sentence. It says, the majority of runners
ran during pregnancy, and then we get all of these numbers. I don't think we need, the majority of,
and then all these numbers. I think we can just say,
70% of runners ran during pregnancy, and then we get all of these details about
the numbers and the different trimesters. I don't think we need all of those. I think we can just pick out
the most interesting one, and the most interesting
number to me was that, almost a third of these women were still
running during their third trimester. So that's the statistic that
I'm going to highlight there. So I changed it to 70% of
runners ran during pregnancy, and then I'm just giving the total
end in the parenthesis, so that we can avoid repeating
the 77 in the second sentence. And then,
I cut all of that material down to and almost one-third ran during
the third trimester, and I didn't think we needed the exact
percentage there, so I got rid of that. For the second and third sentences, you can see that they're both about the
runners cutting back on their mileage and intensity, so we can combine those
two ideas into a single sentence. You'll also notice some repetition. We have from the 77 women
who ran during pregnancy, and then at the end of that
sentence we have, those who ran. So there's some repetition, and we can
make this a little bit more concise. So I paired all of this down to on average
those who ran during pregnancy greatly curtailed their training that setting up
both of those pieces, the mileage and the intensity, and then dash, running just
20.3 plus or minus 9.3 miles per week. These are runners, so
that's actually not a lot for them. And then I put and cutting their intensity to about half
of their non-pregnant running effort. We don't need the 47.9%, plus or
minus 21% about half is just fine there. Then in the next sentence, I didn't
think we needed a small number of 3.9%, 3 out 77,
we don't need all of those statistics. So I'm just going to say three reported
sustaining a running injury while pregnant. It's obvious that three is a small number. And then the last two sentences go through
all of these different statistics about resuming running during
the postpartum period. We don't need all of those, we don't
need to read through the entire table. I picked out two key statistics that
I thought were the most interesting. So I notice that, nearly a quarter of the
women resumed running within two weeks of giving birth, which I thought was a lot. And then I thought it would be important
to highlight what most women did. And so if you look at the table, most
women resumed running within two months, so I'm going to highlight
just those two statistics. So I paired all that down to
in the postpartum period, nearly a quarter,
waited two weeks to resume running. And actually I want to make
that waited two or fewer weeks, To resume running, to highlight the fact
that I thought that was a small amount. They waited two or
fewer weeks to resume running. And most resumed running
within two months. So that was my edit. Your edit may be somewhat different but
hopefully, it pared that down greatly. And here's my final edit written
out if you want to read it without all the red markings.
