So welcome, in this next module
I'm going to be talking with Dr. Gary Friedman. I'm thrilled to have him here today. I've mentioned his name
a few times in this course. He provided a number of the examples
that I've shared with you and he's been a long time champion of good
writing in the medical literature. So it's great to have him here today. He has been an editor at
the American Journal of Epidemiology for over two decades. And was the director of the division
of research at Kaiser Permanente, Northern California for almost a decade. And also he's on the editorial board
of a number of other journals and currently a consulting
professor at Stanford. So I really appreciate you
being here today, Gary. >> It's a pleasure. >> So I'm just going to start by asking, obviously we need to do good science, but
besides good science, what are some of the key elements that journal editors
are looking for when they get a paper? >> Well, one is novelty. We will often reject a paper
without even sending it out for peer review, if it's just a repeat of
findings that are already well known. I mean if you're writing the 30th
paper on alcohol and how alcohol is related to high blood pressure, or
obesity is related to mortality, don't expect people to be
very enthusiastic about it. So we will often reject
a paper right away. Now let me just tell you the process that
we go through with the American Journal of Epidemiology. First it's looked at by the editor
in chief, and then he assigns it to one of the other editors,
who really makes the final decision. And I happen play that role as
a general epidemiology editor. There are other more specialized
editors that work just in cancer or just in cardiovascular disease or
just in infectious disease, but I tend to be more general. And so, if the two of us think that
the paper is not going to be of sufficient priority to be accepted, even if
it's good science and well-reviewed. Then as a favor to the authors,
we won't delay a rejection of it. Besides novelty,
another criteria that we look at is interest to the readers
of this particular journal. For example, sometimes we'll get
a paper that really is not so much an epidemiologic study but
a way to improve public health. And we will decide,
this is really more suitable to a public health journal than to
the American Journal of Epidemiology. We also look for good writing. And this can be especially a problem
with a non English speaking author. Usually when a paper comes from a foreign
country, often the English is really bad. And we know it's going to
need a lot of work. And if we think it's a good study
we will often send it back and say, please have a native English speaker
go through this and edit it. And occasionally,
this comes when a foreign person whose native language is not English works in an American
institution and submits a paper. Usually that is not a problem,
but it can be. Another factor is that,
don't make the paper too long, don't put in too much excess
material that's not needed. And another important problem is what
we call slicing the salami too think. >> Yeah, yeah, that would be great
if you could say a bit about that. >> If you have a study that
involves both men and women and want to try to get two papers out of it. Say, here's the effect of
this risk factor in men and then another paper, here's the the effect
of this risk factor in women. That is really frowned upon by journals. And my own personal experience is that
I had to deal with this as an author. A colleague and I each wrote a paper about
the health effects of cigar smoking. This was at Kaiser Permanente. This was on cardiovascular disease,
mine was on cancer. I submitted mine to the Annals of
Epidemiology, it was accepted. He submitted his to the New England
Journal, it was accepted but they said, do you have something on cancer? So naturally he was younger and
needed publications more than I did. So I sort of fell on my sword, withdrew
my paper from the annals of epidemiology, and combined it with his, and
the New England Journal took it. So even I was faced with
a salami problem as an author, so those are the main things. >> Yeah, sorting those things
out early can be very helpful. And what do you think is, if you had to
point to one thing, the number one mistake that scientists make when submitting
their paper for publication? >> I think it's overconfidence in how
important and how good their study is. >> [LAUGH]
>> You've worked on it really hard-
>> Yeah. >> And
you've done your best to write it up. And this was a topic or a question
that was really important to you, and you think, gosh,
this is really an important finding but others may not value it so high. So if it gets rejected due to some
factor like that, I would persist. I think it's important to persist and
submit it elsewhere, fix it and submit it elsewhere. >> Yeah, finding the right journal for
it might be the key, yeah. >> Right, because you've devoted a year or two to this project and
you think it's really important, don't assume that other people will
place it as high priority as you do. >> Yeah, that's a good point. >> And I have to, of course, ask you
to give some advice to authors about writing style because you've
written a number of editorials in the American Journal of
Epidemiology dealing with writing. So what advice do you have
in terms of the writing? >> Well I guess clarity and
conciseness are what I would put as the highest priority
characteristics of writing. Avoid repetition. Sometimes people will say
something in the introduction and then repeat it in the discussion. Avoid that, or they'll say
something in the methods section, which gets repeated in results. So avoid repetition,
avoid excess verbiage. And I've written editorials about that,
which I think you've mentioned. >> I have, yes. >> And avoid, sometimes people will write a rather long discussion in
the introduction of the paper. Whereas really,
the introduction should be brief. Say why you did this study and
basically what you tried to accomplish. Leave all the discussion,
the review of the literature, for the discussion section. Don't try to put too
much in the introduction. Some things, certainly you need some
background, as to why you did the study, which may involve citing
some previous literature, but don't go into it in detail,
that's in the introduction. And don't repeat numerical
data in the text. You'll have a table, which has nice
numerical data with and ratios, and so on, and then in the results,
Table one shows the blah, blah, blah, and
the odds ratio was this and that. So avoid repeating. We will often ask authors just describe
the finding of the table in words, and the reader can see
the numerical examples. >> Good, yeah. >> So those are my main suggestions. >> Those are good tips, yeah. And one of the fears I think that comes
up often when I am teaching a course like this and has already come up in this class
is a lot of times they will say to me, I've been teaching them to write
in simple and concise language. And they'll say well if I Simplify it too
much, I'm going to dumb down the science, it's going to lose precision. And so there's this kind of fear
that a lot of scientists have, so I was hoping you could
comment on that [LAUGH]. >> Well, I don't think you'll
necessarily dumb down the science. Of course, you do want precision and
clarity, but I think you should avoid jargon and
things that are really hard to understand. George Comstock, who's no longer alive,
but he used to be the editor and chief of the American Journal of
Epidemiology, he used to say that, papers should be understandable by
someone with a good college education or someone who reads the scientific American. It does not have to be
full of jargon that's only understood by your peers in
your particular specialty. >> Yeah.
>> So we welcome things that are very readable, and easy to read. I would not have that fear at all. >> Yeah, and in terms of getting
published, when you get two papers in, let's say, they were the same science and
one was very jargony and sounds sort of the way. [LAUGH] Scientists think they have to
write, and you'd have one that's clear. Can you comment on your
chance of publication? [LAUGH]
>> Well, if both of them get peer reviewed and very highly rated, and
they seem important to the editors. >> Yeah.
>> We might ask, to please explain what you mean
by this word or this sentence. >> Yeah, yeah.
>> So, it will take an extra step if it's really hard to understand and
not clear to most readers. >> Yeah. Yeah, and to have, what advice can you
give specifically to first-time authors? I imagine a lot of the students in this
course are early in their career and haven't had a chance to get published yet or in the process of
submitting their first papers. >> What bothers me most is when
I get a paper, it'll often be from a really good institution and the
senior author at the end of the list is someone who's well known, but it's clear
that it's been written by a student. >> [LAUGH]
>> And it sounds like a thesis, it sounds like a PhD thesis or
master's thesis. >> Yes. Which, and it contains every
conceivable strength of the study, every conceivable weakness. >> [LAUGH]
>> And so to prove in writing the thesis that they learned what they were supposed
to learn in the school public health or in their graduate program. So, Write as if you
were a more established senior scientist who knows what
other scientists understand and you don't have to explain
something to everything. I just happened to see
a paper this morning, a latest issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology that was going over the
strengths and limitations of their study. And it was a study about mortality
in Whites and African Americans related to a certain factor; and it was
saying one of the strengths of our study is that we had a large African American
population as part of the study group. Well, that's sort of obvious, you wouldn't-
>> Right, right. >> You wouldn't be writing about mortality
and so you don't have to say that, I mean. Things that are sort of obvious,
don't say, just say the important limitations of
your study, the important strengths. And you don't have to label
them as strengths and limit. It's there's sort of a jargon now, every academiologic paper you
have to find the word limitation. >> [LAUGH] Yes.
>> [LAUGH] Just state what they are. So, I guess just avoid making
your paper seem like a thesis. >> Yeah, I've encountered that
as well in reviewing papers. >> Yeah
>> Where you could tell that somebody had taken a thesis and
just tried to turn it into a paper, it's a very different product. >> Right.
>> Paying attention to actually writing it like a paper or a thesis,
is a great tip And let's talk a little bit
about resubmission. So let's say that you are offered
the opportunity, the paper's rejected but you're offered the opportunity to resubmit
with a lot of comments from reviewers. What kinds of tips can you give people
who are in that stage of the publication process? >> Well, first of all, although acceptance
of the revision is not guaranteed, and that will say so in the letter, I
think you should take that as encouraging. The fact that it got passed that first
reviewing stage is really a good sign, and you should work hard to improve
the paper so that it will get accepted. And the, first of all, whatever the, first of all list each comment that
the reviewers make and respond to that. It makes it much easier as
an editor to be able to see that the author took
into account every comment. That both reviewers or as many reviewers
who are involved made, and the editor will often make comments too and list
them and respond to each one separately. And either, whatever the comments says, either fix it, fix what the problem is or explain why you don't think that that
criticism is valid or important. Explain why you don't want to fix it,
and give a good argument for that. Show, and also please show the editor where you
made the changes in the manuscript. If someone says well, I just changed
the method section to reflect this, that's sort of hard for
us to find what exactly you did. So, list the changes when
you respond to the comments. Either highlight them in the manuscript,
see where the occur, highlight them or use track changes. Apply in addition to the version where
you get rid of the track changes. Also provide the version
that has track changes so that the editor can see
exactly what you did. >> Yeah. >> Or
sometimes the paper will be sent out for further peer review, sometimes the peer
reviewers have really strong concerns. And I as an editor will
send it back to them and say did the author really satisfy
your concerns about this? And be polite. >> [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] You know, this reviewer's stupid, you know. He didn't really understand,
you say, we thank the reviewers for their constructive criticisms, I'm sure the paper's improved as
a result of this, so that does not hurt. >> It's everybody's instinct I think to at
first be a little defensive when you get your review back. So you have to go back and tweak the
language a little bit to make sure you're being polite, that's a good tip, yeah. And, can you give us some words of
encouragement for young scientists who might have submitted their first paper and
actually got an outright rejection. What are some words for encouragement? [LAUGH]
>> Well, I would just say fix it, and if it's totally rejected by that journal,
they're not asking for re-submission, fix it, try to respond to the reviewer's
comments that you feel are justified, and submit it elsewhere, and persist. As an author, I've had to submit papers
to as many as four journals until it finally got accepted. So I think persistence is important,
don't take the rejection personally. It's hard not to and I sometimes do. But you realize that some reviewers
May not be very competent, may not really understand
what you're doing. This will often happen if you submit an
epidemiologic paper, and it gets reviewed by a clinician who does not really
understand principles of epidemiology. They'll feel that if you
write a paper about stroke, if every case was not reviewed by a
neurologist, then it's not a valid paper. >> Right, right. >> So, or maybe they're competent,
but they just had a bad day. >> [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] And didn't really pay close
attention to what you wrote, and missed some passages that really
would've answered their question. So, just realize that reviewers are human, just like authors, and
that's just the way the system works. >> Yeah, yeah. >> It's not perfect. >> And then talking about
the system a little bit, what changes do you anticipate are
going to occur in the publication process? There's kind of a lot going on now
with the online and open access. >> Right.
>> Say a little bit about what's going to happen for in the future. >> Well, I think you've described it. >> [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] Less paper, more electronic publications. It'll appear faster, like EPUB before
it appears in the paper version, there'll be more new journals. I keep getting emails from
journals that just started up, and they'll make it sound
like it's your field. And there's probably not such
great peer review with them, they want to get some known authors and
publish. But I've had a paper which was submitted
to a journal that's supposed to be peer reviewed, and the acceptance
came back in about five days. [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] >> So I don't think it was really peer reviewed. Of course, I'm biased, but
I thought it was a decent paper. But I don't think it got the kind of peer
review that papers normally get from good journals. >> Do you think peer reviews are going to
change then somewhat in the future because of this proliferation
of online journals? >> Say that again, sorry. >> Do you think that the peer review
process itself is going to change somewhat because of the proliferation
of online journals? >> Well, it shouldn't, but
it might, I'm not sure how. >> Yeah. >> Yeah, if they're really in
a hurry to publish, they might say, get your review back in a week, or. >> Yeah. >> A lot of people just can't do that. >> They can't do it that fast, yeah. >> There was another point
I wanted to make that, now NIH has a policy that if
your paper is supported by them, as part of a grant or contract, even if the journal wants
to charge money for downloading the paper, after a year, NIH will put it on PubMed
as a finished manuscript. Which may not have had the kind of copy
editing that will finally appear in the journal, but it'll at least be
your final version of the manuscript. And so, you'll be able to read papers
that have been out for a year, for no cost, even if the journal is a kind
that wants to charge money for it. >> That's great to know. And if you could change one thing
about the publication process, what would you change? >> Well, when you asked me that
question before, I got two things. [LAUGH]
>> Two is fine, [LAUGH]. >> First of all,
I think there should be greater valuation of negative findings by both
researchers and by the journals. When you do studies, you're going to
have this great idea that you think something is a cause or
a prevention of some disease, and you're going to do a study,
and it's not going to pan out. That is the most common experience
that we epidemiologists have. In fact, and I've now got a graduate
student here who is doing a study of Metformin in relation
to risk of breast cancer, because there was some thought that
this might be preventive agent for reducing the risk of certain
kinds of breast cancer. And this is being done at Kaiser
Permanente in our division of research. But it's looking like, and this is not
a final result, but it's looking like that it's probably not going to turn up
what was hoped for, or what was expected. And naturally, the researcher's
very disappointed in that, but this is important to know, too,
that there's a negative finding. So don't be discouraged if
you have a negative finding, it's important that that get published. And I wish that journals would be
more interested in publishing these, sometimes a negative finding,
if you want to get it out there, could be written in
the form a brief report, which will take less journal space,
it will get higher priority. So I think that is my main
answer to your question. I also wish that there was greater ease in
getting peer reviewers to review a paper. Sometimes, we have a list at
the American Journal of Epidemiology, and I send a particular paper out to people
who said this was their specialty, or special interest. And out of 10 people who we send it to,
only one agreed to review, and we try to get two, and I was asked, can you make
a decision on just the one review? because we can't keep
trying to get reviewers. So, as a scientist and
an author, please accept the responsibility of being a reviewer,
as well as an author. And we've had some cases where we've
published papers by a certain author, and this author consistently
refused to review papers, and naturally they're not well
regarded by the editorial staff. So, those would be my two concerns. >> Yeah that's a good point, a good tip. And the opportunity to review is
a good way to learn also as an author. >> Absolutely. >> So, great,
is there any parting thoughts or tips that you want to offer to the class? >> No, I think we've covered it. >> Great, okay.
>> Your questions are so good that you've covered everything
that I might want to say. >> Thank you so much for
taking the time to speak with us. >> You're very welcome.
