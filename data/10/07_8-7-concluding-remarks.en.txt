I hope you've enjoyed this course. I hope this course will make your writing life easier and more fun. Please share your future success stories with me. I enjoy hearing about these. As a scientist, you have a responsibility to communicate your science clearly and effectively and to as broad an audience as possible. We live in an era of science denial. Science and facts are under attack. As scientists, we have to do a better job of communicating science in a clear, accessible and engaging way. Please spread the word and pass on the skills you've learned in this class to other scientists to help them become better communicators.
