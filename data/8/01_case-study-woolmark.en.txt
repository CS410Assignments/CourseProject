Hi everyone. In this clip, we are going to further investigate best cases of authority and lifestyle brands and their relation with products. We are going to analyze first the Woolmark case on authority in wool, Merino wool production and distribution. And then we are going to have a talk with the General Manager of Lander Italy leading American consulting company in branding. Let's start from Woolmark. When you buy a woolen garment usually you feel reassured when you see the Woolmark logo. In fact, Woolmark is an authority a global authority I would say in Merino wool. Woolmark is a brand that is owned by the Australian Wool Innovation Limited. That is a company that is grouping 20 now thousand wool growers in Australia. The aim of this company is to research and market the qualities of Merino Wool down the pipeline and supply chain. So in partnership with wool growers, manufacturers, fashion designers, retailers, and the final customers. Wool has a lot of properties. It's breathable, it's renewable, it's natural, it's comfortable. So the Woolmark company is promoting these qualities through targeted marketing campaigns with different segments of the fashion market. From kids wear to sports wear, to high end fashion. Acting as a global brand of course it has to protect its authority status in the international market place. Allowing companies that are willing
to use the Woolmark logo to use it only after a test actually of their quality standard. But let's see more about the authority status of Woolmark looking at this very interesting video.
