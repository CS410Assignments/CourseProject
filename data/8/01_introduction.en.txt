Welcome to retail week. The topic we are going to cover in this module is related to the distribution strategies of fashion and luxury brands. This is a very hot topic. I’ll tell you a little bit how we're going to go through these topics. The first thing will be about the definition of these issues. What does retail management mean and why is it different from wholesale management? Then we will introduce the different channels and the different retail formats. Fashion and luxury brands must manage in a multi-channeled kind of environment. Another topic that we will follow will be about retail and the distribution strategies in terms of activities and roles. Then we will go into the topic of how to manage a retail identity when you have your own store as a branded company and you want to express your identity in terms of products, stories, and images into the retail space. We will conclude with a very interesting part that is about success cases. The best cases that we’ve selected in order to help you understand what are the best practices in retail identity management and store management? What are the perspectives of top managers about the evolution of the omni-channel world? How and where internet is going? How to design the best customer experience in the retail place?
