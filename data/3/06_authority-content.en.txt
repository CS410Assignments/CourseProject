[MUSIC] In this lesson, we're going to
use one of our favorite words. No, it's not revenue,
although we like that one too. It's authority and specifically,
authority-building content. So, anyone who's at all familiar with what
we do, knows that use this word a lot. And in this lesson, we're going to talk
about why it's such an important concept, what kind of benefits it
brings to the business and then, what makes it work well. So let's talk about what authority
content means in our business. Because it's not just being a blow
hard and going on and on and on about what you know. It's much more subtle and
it's much more interactive than that. Wouldn't you say so, Brian?
