[MUSIC] Welcome back. For this lesson, my colleague,
Brian Clark, and I, discuss the first two A's of
the framework, agility and authenticity. This podcast has been
divided into three segments. In the first segment, Brian discusses
how he came up with the first day of the framework, and why being agile is
a recommended part of the framework. In the second segment, we discuss how to practice being
agile with your content strategy. And the final segment,
we switch gears to discuss authenticity. And hopefully when you hear our discussion
you can then assess what authenticity means to you in your organization. The seven A framework really gives
the context for your content strategy and for your content tactics. So this is really about some
ideas that you need to accept, or your organization needs to accept. Your client, your boss, whatever it might be, before you can move
really move forward and have success. These are phases. Everybody needs to go through these
kind of conceptual phases and make them part of your way of working. And that sets the contexts
to be successful.
