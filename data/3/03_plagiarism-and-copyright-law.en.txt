[MUSIC] Hello, welcome back. So we can't talk about ethics
without about plagiarism. And we can't talk about plagiarism without
at least touching on copyright law. This lesson follows well
with the previous lesson. And what you should be able to do
is identify unethical behavior or copyright infringement when you're
working with images, quotes, etc. You should be able to
recognize your own ethics, and use strategies that are considered
ethical professional behavior. So here's what I want you to
understand about copyright law. It is not as simple as some
people would have you believe. And I like to say, don't be a Facebook lawyer, in other words
don't be that person who gets legal advice on Facebook despite the fact that you
have no idea what you're talking about. You're not an attorney, you've never
represented a copyright case in court. And don't listen to Facebook lawyers, don't listen to people who will give
you advice about that's fair use, that's not fair use, and they really
don't have the expertise to do that. Whether or not a particular image,
or a quote, or whatever is fair use, is actually decided
case by case by a jury. And of course there are guidelines and
best practices. There are things you should do and
things that don't make sense to do. And again, that's for
an attorney to advise you on, based on the specifics of your situation,
because it can change. And you can actually find all
kinds of copyright cases won by people who would say,
well that's fair use. Well, the jury did not say it
was fair use, and so it wasn't. Now the simple way of course to get
around this is to never to use material you didn't create or you didn't pay for. And when I say you,
I mean your organization. Do not let your organization try to get
away with using images from the web. Going to a Google image search,
doing a search, and then using that image to illustrate
a podcast, a video, or a post. Most companies won't do that, but I have
seen so many crazy things in my work life. So you know you have
the rights to an image, and images are particularly sensitive. You know you have the rights to it
if your company paid for it, or if they had a photographer take it for
the company as a work for hire. And as your legal team will tell you, there's also a question of the person
who you took the photo of. Have they signed a release for
their image to used? That again is taken care of when you
do things like buy stock photos, is taken care of when your company
pays to photograph models on a shoot. So your legal will be able to
tell you all about that, but if you don't have a legal team and
you use pictures of people, typically the stock photo companies will have all
that paperwork taken care of for you. But it's not a bad idea to just read that legal stuff that they
show you when you buy an image. And I say this because copyright claims, including requests for damages,
which means requests for money, are increasingly common
with content and on the web. And so getting caught using an image
that you don't own the rights to, can actually be very expensive. So you just want to be aware of that fact,
and play it a little conservative. And then, of course, don't use
other people's words as your own, unless you're a ghostwriter and
you've been paid for it. You will in practice probably
ghostwrite quite a bit for other people as a content marketer. It's very common to be asked for that. It's a normal practice. I have no problem with it ethically,
because it's clear going into it that that's the arrangement, and
you're compensated for it. Now it may be that you're not ethically
comfortable with ghostwriting because, let's face it,
it is participating in an untruth. You write the content and the world thinks that the CEO wrote it
,or at least the gullible world does. So if you have a problem with it you
need to let your organization sort of know that up front. Because the expectation will normally be
that you'll be willing to ghostwrite very commonly for the executive team or the
founder, and try and recreate their voice. Now when we're talking about quotes,
text quotes, you're quoting from a published work,
or another website, or you're quoting anybody else's words that
you didn't write and you didn't pay for. Just keep in mind that part about the jury
decides what's fair use and what's not. There are legal guidelines, normally we do use quotes in content and
it's not a problem. If you have a legal department,
just make they're comfortable with it. It is never a bad idea to ask permission
if it's somebody else on the web who you would be able to contact. A little caution, again,
will help a great deal. The rules will change a little bit for
contact, just a blog post, published on the web,
publisher discoverable. Going to advertising, something put in
a brochure or an advertising website. Now again, that line gets blurry, between
marketing copy on a website and content. Very blurry. And then the roles change a little bit
more if you're actually going to use it in a product, a product that you sell. So again, legal team, your friend. So talking about ethics, let's talk a little bit about
side hustles and moonlighting. Now in my professional experience, most writers who are employees in
an organization do some moonlighting. You should let the people you work
with know if you're taking side jobs. And of course, the main thing is
don't let any kind of side gig or side hustle interfere with the primary
work you're getting paid for. Make sure you're delivering
what you're being paid for. But whether or not you are moonlighting
for pay, for compensation, I think every writer and
content marketer needs to have a website that you use to promote and
maintain your own brand as a professional. So, normally that's a blog. Sometimes you can combine
that with a podcast. And then that blog should have pointers
to excellent material you have written. Content, guest posts, if you can get it,
portfolio pieces for your clients. And ideally, you have all of that in one
place when you started your assignment or your new job. And then that's just part and
parcel of who you are. And let them know that you do plan to
maintain your blog just as a professional, just to keep your professional
network open and healthy. So, here is something I have seen,
so I will warn you not to do it. I think you're probably
too savvy to do this, but never gossip about your
co-workers on your blog. And never gossip or say anything
negative about the employer or your contract, when you're employed there. And I know that that
sounds kind of obvious but I've seen people get stuck by it. And I think the reason people get stuck,
is they have a feeling that their blog and also their social media posts,
their Facebook posts, LinkedIn, Twitter,
Google +, whatever it is. Whatever platform it might be. People are under the apprehension
that this is private, and it is not at all private. Even if your Facebook account
is pretty locked down, even oddly enough if
you're using a pseudonym. People have been fired for
making kind of comments, or inappropriate behavior,
racist behavior, racism, straight up inappropriate,
always in every aspect of your life. Do not do it, it's not ethical and
it's not being a good person. Doing these things in private, theoretically anything
on the web can be found. And anything on the web can be shared. Even on a private conference or
a private Facebook group. Don't say it if you're not willing
to be held accountable for it. And then just a final wrap
up on professionalism. It seems like a small thing. It's rarer than you might think. Master this and
you will do really well professionally. You will get recommendations,
you'll find it easy to get new jobs. Meet your deadlines. Seems so simple, but so
many writers don't do it. Are there really isn't any excuse for it. Real emergencies, a real emergency where you cannot
get to your deadline is so rare. Especially if you have started work in
a reasonable amount of time to complete the project, and
you've given yourself some wiggle room. So meet your deadlines. Meet your deadlines. Meet your deadlines. It's so key to professionalism. It will really make you stand out,
and it's easy to do. You just have to get a little
bit of a handle on your time. All right, so
I'm just going to sum this up for you so you can just kind of get a refresher. Don't lie and
don't agree to participate in lies. Make friends with the lawyers. Set the right expectations with customers
or clients of the organization. Advocate for those customers and clients, and make them your priority for
the good of the whole organization. With a few exceptions,
don't use images, sound files, or text, that your company didn't create or
pay for. Do not gossip about your colleagues or
organization on your blog or your social media accounts. Do not publish anything in any medium,
with or without a pseudonym, unless you
are willing to be held accountable for it. And finally, meet those deadlines.
