[MUSIC] Hello and welcome, I'm Sonia Simone, this module is about
the Content Marketing Ecosystem. I want to talk about the what
content marketing is, and why everyone is talking about it. I'm the Chief Content Officer for
Copyblogger Media. When I started my writing career, there was no such thing as
a Chief Content Officer. In fact, I did content marketing for
years without that label. Copyblogger as a blog, has blogged for
years about content marketing, well before that term existed. Now it's all over the place. There are hundreds of job listings for
content marketers every week, especially in the more tech savvy locations,
like the San Francisco Bay Area. Some people think content is a matter of
cool advertising, great advertising that companies like, Coca-Cola have been
producing for years and years. Some people actually think it
means you don't sell anything. It's some kind of zero sales
approach where you just produce something interesting,
but there's no call to action. There's no traditional marketing and
sales copyrighting involved. Some people think it's new,
which it's not as a matter of fact, it's actually a fairly old tradition. It's about as old as advertising itself. [MUSIC]
