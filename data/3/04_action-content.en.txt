[MUSIC] So today we're going to
talk about action content. This is really where all
the work you're being paid for as a content marketer starts
translating into revenue for yourself, for your clients, for
your organization, what have you. And it's really about content that's
designed to get somebody to take the next action. So I think we should probably start by
saying there are some of our students who are already students of what's usually
called direct response copywriting. And if that's you, you know very well that
this is really about polishing your craft and continuing to master the fundamentals
and continuing to explore the nuances. So we may throw a few new things at you,
but keep studying that art because it is
where the art is translated into revenue.
