[MUSIC] Welcome back everybody. Today we are going to get hip
deep in some nerdy goodness. In this series of five videos, we
introduce you to the world of metrics for content marketers. And for this conversation I invited
my colleague, Jessica Frick. She's Rainmaker Digital's Executive
Vice President of Operations, but she's also a very passionate enthusiast
about the whole topic of metrics, data, and data driven marketing. I'm so pleased you're able to make time,
because this is Jess's area of genius. And she's going to get deep with us today. It's going to be fun and interesting. So let's start off by talking
about data driven decisions and marketing departments in companies. Maybe just lay a little wisdom on us
about why we make data driven decisions.
