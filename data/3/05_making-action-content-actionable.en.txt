[MUSIC] In the last lesson, Brian and
I defined the idea of Action Content. Content that prompts your
audience to do something. In this lesson, I want to talk a little bit about what
makes Action Content actually function. What is it that makes it get
the action that you're looking for? And you can say every page on
your website is a landing page. There are people who have made this point. Seth Godin intriguingly
has made that point. He wrote a book called the Big Red Fez, which is about how every page on
the web should have something that's as obvious as a red fez on a monkey
telling people what to do next. Which is interesting because we don't
think of Seth as being a real hard core direct response guy. But he has a pretty solid direct
response background actually. But let's talk about what makes it work,
what are some of the components? I talked to you guys already a little bit
about the elements of action content, some of the things you need to include. We're going to touch on a few of those and
just reinforce that in this lesson. We have to talk a little
bit about headlines. We've talked about them in the past,
but the headline if it isn't right, you're just not going to get any
traction with anything that you do. What do you think, Brian?
