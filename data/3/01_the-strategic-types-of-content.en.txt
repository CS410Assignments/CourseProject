[MUSIC] Hello, welcome back. For this module we wanted to explore with
you all the strategic types of content that go into an effective
content marketing program. Different types of content play different
roles, and they do different things for the business. This module is made up of four
podcast lessons where Brian Clark and I walk through the four different
types of general content. Please keep in mind these are not
necessarily mutually exclusive. Sometimes a piece of content
can play more than one role and they should work together. They should be congruent. They should all have the same look,
the same feel, the same voice but
they do serve different purposes. So because of that,
they have some different attributes and we're going to talk about
what those attributes are and how to incorporate them
into your strategies. After completing this module and
all the supplemental materials and activities you'll be able to identify and define the four types of strategic
content which include attraction content, affinity content, action content,
and authority content. So we have more A's for
you, A's all around. You should also be able to use
the strategies we provide to write the various types of content presented. Skilled writing will be able to combine
all four elements into one content piece. So without further adieu, let's dive in. [MUSIC]
