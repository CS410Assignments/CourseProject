[MUSIC] Hello, welcome back. This is the final module in this course,
and will focus on managing not only your content, but how you should manage
yourself as a professional. [MUSIC] Ethics plays a huge role in
successful organizations. And although it might sound obvious
to work and act with ethics and professionalism you'd be surprised
what I've seen on the web. So we'll spend some time talking
about what it means to be ethical, professional and how plagiarism and
copyright laws come into play. Then I want to shift gears and
discuss metrics. And I know you're probably thinking I'm
a word person not a numbers person. Well I invited my colleague, Jessica
Frick, to help explain why you should care about the numbers as part of your
effective content marketing strategy. And don't worry, we'll help you focus on
the right metrics for the work you do. And finally, in the last couple lessons
I want to discuss more about multimedia. Visual, audio, and video that can really
help make what you write come to life. So, let's get started.
