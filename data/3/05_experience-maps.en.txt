[MUSIC] So in this lesson we're going to talk
about experience maps and once again, Brian Clarke is joining me for
this podcast. We've divided this lesson
into three segments. For the first segment, Brian and I will
define what an experience map is and examine its purpose in developing
a content marketing strategy. As Brian put it, you have to know
what type of content to deliver when. In the second segment of the podcast,
we'll dissect and illustrate the various
components of an experience map. In the final segment, we'll discuss four
tips in creating a usable experience map. So, to start, I have a quote here from
a gentleman named Adam Richardson. The experience map is the sum
totality of how customers engage with your company and brand. Not just a snapshot in time, but throughout the entire
arc of being a customer. Brian, what do you think about this quote?
