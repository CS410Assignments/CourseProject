[MUSIC] Welcome back, we've divided
this lesson into two segments. Brian, Clark and
I talked about content strategy and we're going to get to it on
a bit more granular level. Because it's awesome to discuss
things like the 7A framework which will really set the context. And it's an important context for
success but at some point, you got to sit down and you get to it. You get in the details and
start actually put your plan together. And that's whether you're talking about
your content marketing strategy for yourself and your own services. Or if you're talking about your clients,
or the organization you're working in. At some point you have to sit down and
just get nitty-gritty. So that's the intent for this lesson,
which we've broken into two segments. The first explores mapping the journey
by examining the buyer's journey or the sales funnel. And then the second, we discuss
the buyer persona, so let's dive in.
