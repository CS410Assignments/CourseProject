[MUSIC] In this lesson, we're continuing
our content type session, and we're going to talk
about affinity content. As I mentioned last time,
this one is not nearly as obvious, as self evident, as attraction content. Everyone knows you need
attraction content. Everyone is creating
traffic oriented content. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it,
it's part of the game. Affinity content is a little more
subtle and it's very, very powerful. And I think every business,
small business, solo business, big business
needs to be thinking about this. Actually the giant companies, the Coca Cola's, certainly the Apple's,
they think a lot about this question. As a marketer in probably what's
going to be a smaller organization, you want to be thinking this way as well. As I mentioned, Brian Clark is
joining me for this conversation. And by the end of the lesson,
you should be able to recognize and write affinity content for your audience. So, I'll start by asking Brian, why don't
you talk about affinity content as we've been working with it and
defining it at Copy Blogger
