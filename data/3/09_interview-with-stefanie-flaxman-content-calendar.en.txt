[MUSIC] Welcome back. As I mentioned in the last lesson,
this lesson is the second part of my interview with Stefanie Flaxman,
our Editor in Chief of Copy Blogger. In this part of the interview,
Stefanie will describe the benefits and importance of having a content calendar,
and how we approach it at Copy Blogger. I hope you found the material for this
module helpful and useful, as you begin to build your content marketing strategy for
both you and your organization. Enjoy the rest of the podcast.
