[MUSIC] Welcome back everyone. Today we're going to talk about that heart
of what really makes content marketing work, which is the relationship
between the audience and authority. If you get these right everything
else is going to get a lot easier. And I don't want to encourage
people to get things wrong, but you can get a lot wrong if you
have these two things dialed in. For this podcast I've asked
Brian Clark to join me again, since within what we
call the 7A framework, there's this critical relationship
between the audience and authority. Now, we've divided this
lesson into three segments. In the first segment, we'll discuss the
relationship of authority and audience. In the second segment, we'll discuss what
we mean by having a strong personality. And we'll wrap up this module with our
third segment geared toward confidence. By the end of this lesson, you should
practice writing with authority and confidence. When it comes to authority and
audience, some people have one, and they don't have the other. And that's really not helpful. But I think that word authority,
it's a very charged word, which is part of why we use it,
because it has a lot of energy. But it has some baggage
that might not be useful. So you've been using the word
authority for a long time. When you talk about authority in this
sense, what does it look like to you?
