[MUSIC] Hey, welcome back. Welcome to the second module in the course
where I want to introduce you to the Strategic Context or what we
affectionately call the 7A Framework. We're going to dive deeper
into each of the 7As. Some of them I'm going to
do as stand alone sessions, some of them I do with my
colleague Bryan Clerk. At the end of this section of the course,
you're going to get the framework. The framework is something you
need to have in place mentally to be on top of you game in order to
start creating content in the right way. If you don't have
an understanding of the context, it's very difficult to create
content that actually works. This session does have a little bit of
homework, we have some eBooks for you, we have a couple of eBooks
on the 7As specifically. We have one all about the agile mindset,
we have one that covers the 7A framework in a little more depth and we also have a
networking eBook about content promotion, we have an eBook about copy writing. So for today,
I want you to focus on the 7A eBooks, and just get a good understanding
of the framework.
