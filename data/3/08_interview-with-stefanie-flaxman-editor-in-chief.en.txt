[MUSIC] For the last two lessons within this
module, I asked Stefanie Flaxman, our Editor-in-Chief at Copyblogger, to
join me for a podcast interview to discuss the editorial process for content
marketers and content marketing teams. We divided this interview into two
parts to make it more adjustable for your learning. So let me start by introducing Stefanie, who's had a parade of titles within
the Copyblogger organization. She started off as our manager
of editorial standards, which was kind of hilarious. We all teased the person
who came up with that, writing the wordiest title
in the entire company. But I kind of like it because today,
she's our Editor-in-Chief, but I like that editorial
standards just because it gives that feeling of being
the guardian of quality. In this first part of the interview we'll
discuss how Copyblogger produces content, the multiple authors who contribute,
how we handle images and more. So let's get started.
