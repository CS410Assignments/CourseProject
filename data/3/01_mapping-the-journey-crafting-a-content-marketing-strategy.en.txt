[MUSIC] Hello, welcome back, I'm Sonia Simone. This module is about crafting
a content marketing strategy. And in order to do that, you really need
to understand the journey of your buyer or audience. Content marketing is about
getting in front of a customer or a potential customer even
before they know your customer. It's about anticipating their needs even
before they know what they want, and its about ensuring that they
come back to you as a company or organization they can trust. I asked Brian Clark, our CEO, to join me to discuss mapping the journey
of your customer or audience. This module is broken into four lessons, with the first three lessons
in a podcast interview format. In the first lesson, we explore the
buyer's journey, and the buyer's persona, why is it important to always
be thinking about their journey? In the second lesson,
Brian and I identify and describe the importance of an empathy map,
and how to go about producing one as a major component of crafting
a content marketing strategy. Unfortunately, this step tends to
be overlooked by many companies. Once you have your empathy map, your next step is to build an experience
map which is covered in the third lesson. An experience map will provide you with
key insights into the touchpoints between your customers and
your company or organization. And in the final lesson of the module,
you'll have an ability to practice and demonstrate two key skills and
creating irresistible content. So without further ado, lets get started. [MUSIC]
