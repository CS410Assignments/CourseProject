[MUSIC] Good to see you. In this lesson, we're going to jump into a
nice, meaty topic, and there's going to be lots for you to do, not just listen to,
so that'll be a good thing. In this lesson,
we'll discuss empathy maps. And this is a specific technique
that you're going to do to assess the types of people you're
creating content for, which is not necessarily what most
of your competitors are doing. To discuss empathy maps, I invited
Brian Clark to join me in this podcast. So we're going to jump right into it,
and talk about what empathy is and why it's important,
why does it matter in business. So take it away, Brian.
