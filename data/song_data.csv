 Chris Janson ,Drunk Girl,"Couple cover charge stamps got her hand looking like a rainbow In and out of every bar on a whim just like the wind blows She's either a bachelorette or coming off a breakup Take a drunk girl home She's bouncing like a pinball Singing every word she never knew Dancing with her eyes closed like she's the only one in the room Her hair's a perfect mess  falling out of that dress Take a drunk girl home  Take a drunk girl home Let her sleep all alone Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone Pick up her life she threw on the floor Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man Take a drunk girl home  You leave her drive for a dive and you get something bad to eat They're singing ""Closing Time"" at that little bar across the street In two by twos  strangers and lovers headed for the covers  hooking up That TV in your two bedroom sounds turned off And through the paper-thin walls  you can hear the neighbor’s cigarette cough There's a million things you could be doing  but there's one thing you're damn sure glad you did Take a drunk girl home Let her sleep all alone Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone Pick up her life she threw on the floor Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door That's how ya know the difference between a boy and man You take a drunk girl home  You took a drunk girl home In the sober light of dawn She left you a message she thanks you on the phone 'Cause you picked up her life she threw on the floor You left the hall lights on walked out and locked the door That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man Take a drunk girl home You take a drunk girl home Take a drunk girl home1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

 Chris Janson ,Holdin’ Her,Well  I woke up in places that I couldn't remember Who's lyin' next to me or even how I got there And that's hard to believe but that's how I used to roll  One Tuesday night  in an underground pool hall That's where I saw her for the first time  right around last call She stole my heart and I started walkin' down a new road  And  oh  when I'm holdin' her It's like peace on Earth Where time stands still And love's the only thing  yeah  that I feel When she's in my arms No matter where we are Well  I am right at home When I'm holdin' her  Now  on a park bench down on 4th Street  that's where I popped the question And to my amazement  she actually said yes Tears filled my eyes as I slipped a ring on her hand  Oh  then a few short years later God put into my world A 6 pound and 8 ounce sweet baby girl And ever since that day  let me tell you now  I became a brand new man Because when I'm holdin' her It's like peace on Earth Where time stands still And love's the only thing  yeah  that I feel When she's in my arms No matter where... no matter where we are Well  I am right at home When I'm holdin' her  I am right at home When I'm holdin' herEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Two years later  it felt like you were a million miles away from me And I was the one on stage  drunk  barely holdin' on on ABC Hope your dad still prays for me  Drinkin' too much  drinkin' too much Since you been gone  I can't get gone enough I'm on top of the world  goin' down I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around Drinkin' too much  drinkin' too much Since you been gone  I can't get gone enough I'm on top of the world  I'm goin' down I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around A year ago  I was in a hotel room in Phoenix Wonderin' if it's ever okay to lie 'Cause I knew the truth would make you wanna die But I told you everything  and you told me to have a good life But you still couldn't believe it was really goodbye Every night  you'd fill the bathtub up Lie there for hours  put your face under water and cry I never wanted to be a heartbreaker Turn your sisters and their friends into matchmakers I know you think my dreams came true Since you been gone  singin' these songs are just something to do The only dream I ever had was you I hope you know I'm still in love It's the kind that you can't fall out of  Drinkin' too much  drinkin' too much Since you been gone  I can't get gone enough I'm on top of the world  goin' down I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around Drinkin' too much  drinkin' too much Since you been gone  I can't get gone enough I'm on top of the world  I'm goin' down I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around (Now it's almost gone) I know this might seem like a contradiction And the last thing you need is more unwanted attention But you changed your number and moved And this is the only way I could reach you So wherever you are  turn it up and listen  Hannah Lee  I'm on my way to you Nobody can love you like I do I don't know what I'm gon' say to you But I know there ain't no way  know there ain't no way Know there ain't no way we're through3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Sam Hunt ,Bottle It Up (Acoustic),Night sand felt good on sunburned feet Sitting on pool chairs we drug to the beach But that salty air was bittersweet Waiting for the sun to rise Best friends talking 'bout the memories we made We couldn't believe that we were graduating The wind and the waves were slipping away but that moment felt so alive  If I could bottle it up I'd have a stash in the truck Splash in my cup  it'd never get old One little sip  just a taste on my lip I'd be taking a trip  wherever I go I'd keep a life's good  sweet bliss 'Does it ever really get better than this?' kinda buzz If I could bottle it up If I could bottle it up  Well the year me  and my grandad fixed that car It was a summer full of grease and changing parts But when we finally got that thing to start Man  it sounded just right Riding with the prettiest girl I know Breaking in a brand new record on an old back road When that first slow love song came on She couldn't hide that little smile If I could bottle it up I'd have a stash in the truck Splash in my cup  it'd never get old One little sip  just a taste on my lip I'd be taking a trip  wherever I go I'd keep a life's good  sweet bliss 'Does it ever really get better than this?' kinda buzz If I could bottle it up If I could bottle it up  And I'd drink it down And I'd pass it around  pass it around Cause it'll sneak up on you fast When life pours out the good stuff Just can't make it last That moment in time would never end Cause I'd take it with me when it did  If I could bottle it up I'd have a stash in the truck Splash in my cup  it'd never get old One little sip  just a taste on my lip I'd be taking a trip  wherever I go I'd keep a life's good  sweet bliss 'Does it ever really get better than this?' kinda buzz If I could bottle it up If I could bottle it up  If I could bottle it up3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Sam Hunt ,Raised On It (Acoustic),"Snapbacks and Levi jeans PBR and burnt CDs Running for the grass on the hot concrete We're still working on our summer feet Cheap gas and Reddy ice Trunk music and headlight fights Dodging the smoke from a riverbank fire A pretty girl and a pickup line like ""Hey what's your name  you know smoke follows beauty  baby""  We stayed up all night long  made our drinks too strong Feeling ten feet tall Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night Like oh-oh-oh oh oh Breaking our boots in  stompin' on the ground we grew up on Yeah  we were raised on it (raised on it) Worked hard and played on it We had it made on it We were born and raised on it  Car wash at the custom tent Sticky quarters and pine tree scent The only sign that we ever got stuck Is the muddy chain in the back of the truck 5-1's with a 20 on top Three guard at the barber shop Duckin' from your ex at the 4-way stop Turn the music down when you're passing the cops We stayed up all night long  made our drinks too strong Feeling ten feet tall Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night Like oh-oh-oh oh oh Breaking our boots in  stompin' on the ground we grew up on Yeah  we were raised on it (raised on it) Worked hard and played on it We had it made on it We were born and raised on it  Mama's prayers and daddy's speech Front porch philosophies A little too young and dumb to see Just what it all meant to me  We stayed up all night long  made our drinks too strong Feeling ten feet tall Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night Like oh-oh-oh oh oh Breaking our boots in  stompin' on the ground we grew up on Yeah  we were raised on it (raised on it) Worked hard and played on it We had it made on it We were born and raised on it Mmm yeah When that sun starts sinking When they turn those open signs around We thought we ran this town Running around just Breaking hearts and curfew Out in the yard with no shoes Staying cool in a Nylon pool Foul ball headed for the parking lot And those Saturday mornings we sleep late ATVs and fire breaks Worn out jeans  black eyed peas  backroads and blue skies I was born and raised on it Might have misbehaved on it Worked hard and played on it We had it madeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

 Sam Hunt ,Break Up In A Small Town (Acoustic),"I knew I'd see her around I'd be at some party  she'd show up and I'd be walking out Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister I'd look up  she'd be at the red light beside me In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back I'd act like I didn't see her We'd pay at the same pumps Flip through the same stations And slow down for the same curves Run around with the same crowds We just needed some time She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine Thought I would be fine  heh  but maybe not I knew she'd find a way to get over me But I'd never thought that...  She would get down with somebody I know I guess that's just how it goes When you break up in a small town I see our friends and they put on a show Like they don't want me to know So they give me the go-around But there's only so many streets  so many lights I swear it's like I can't even leave my house I should've known all along You gotta move or move on When you break up in a small town For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key But now it's like these county lines are closing in on me I see 'em everywhere together And it's hitting a little too close to home She's so far gone  but she didn't go far She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard In someone else's arms right down the road And I never thought that...  She would get down with somebody I know I guess that's just how it goes When you break up in a small town I see our friends and they put on a show Like they don't want me to know So they give me the go-around But there's only so many streets  so many lights I swear it's like I can't even leave my house I should've known all along You gotta move or move on When you break up in a small town  Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him And I wanna jump out I wanna fight I wanna say  ""... that guy!"" but I can't It's my fault  I let her go I never thought that...

 Joey + Rory ,When I’m Gone,A bright sunrise will contradict the heavy fault that weighs you down In spite of all the funeral songs The birds will make their joyful sounds You wonder why the earth still moves You wonder how youll carry on But youll be okay on that first day when Im gone Dusk will come with fireflies and whippoorwill and crickets call And every star will take its place And silvery gown and purple shawl Youll lie down in our big bed Dread the dark and dread the dawn But youll be alright on that first night when Im gone You will reach for me in vain Youll be whispering my name As if sorrow were your friend And this world so in the end But life will call with daffodil And morning glorious blue skies Youll think of me some memory And softly smile to your surprise And even though you love me still You will know where you belong Just give it time well both be fine When Im goneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Joey + Rory ,The Gift,A poor orphan girl named Maria Was walking to market one day She stopped for a rest by the roadside Where a bird with a broken wing lay A few moments passed till she saw it For it's feathers were covered with sand But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling In the warmth of Maria's small hand She happily gave her last peso On a cage made of rushes and twine She fed it loose corn from the market And watched it grow stronger with time Now the Christmas Eve service was coming And the church shone with tinsel and light And all of the townsfolk brought presents To lay by the manger that night There were diamonds and incense and perfumes In packages fit for a king But for one ragged bird in a small cage Maria had nothing to bring She waited till just before midnight So no one could see her go in And crying she knelt by the manger For her gift was unworthy of Him Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness Maria  what brings you to me If the bird in the cage is your offering Open the door  let me see Though she trembled  she did as he asked her And out of the cage the bird flew Soaring into the rafters On a wing that had healed good as new Just then the midnight bells rang out And the little bird started to sing A song that no words could recapture Whose beauty was fit for a king Now Maria felt blessed just to listen To that cascade of notes sweet and long As her offering was lifted to heaven By the very first nightingale's songEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 SayWeCanFly ,Heaven Is Hell,There's a wind blowing in my heart And with my eyes I cannot see my way out of the dark I am a wolf  in my bare feet praying for a spark And as I sleep I feel the rain as it rips my throat apart And my paw prints are stained with blood I follow the moon when I can't trust the sun I've been unfaithful  I let these hands sink so low If I'm an angel  why do these wings cut my throat? What beauty lies here in this pile of broken bones? Without you I would never know There's an answer somewhere in the sky But like the earth I will accept that every flower grows and dies And if you just look close enough you will see it in my eyes That heaven's what I seek  but hell is what I find And my paw prints are stained with blood I follow the moon when I can't trust the sun I've been unfaithful  I let these hands sink so low If I'm an angel  why do these wings cut my throat? What beauty lies here in this pile of broken bones? Without you I would never know The cigarettes and nicotine The alcohol and crazy dreams Are all the things that make me up to be so human Never knowing what I want  just trying to live with what I got I don't know if I'm here or not  I might lose it What the hell is it that you want from me? I'm losing everything. I'm just trying to breathe I'm just trying to breathe And what is it that you want from me I'm losing everything. I'm just trying to breathe I'm just trying to breathe I've been unfaithful  I let these hands sink so low If I'm an angel  why do these wings cut my throat?

I notice the heart in my chest getting heavy And both of my lungs getting older. I notice our bodies together. Oh God  I just want that forever. When we die. Let's die alone  die alone. That way only you and I. Will know where we go  where we go. Maybe we'll be alright And maybe we won't  maybe we won't. When we die  when we die. Let's just go home. When she falls  Heaven and all in between. Pray that one day maybe they'll be able to hold her again. And her blood  flows in the veins of the trees. Breathing stardust into the leaves. Everything's changing again. I notice my breath getting colder. I notice your breath getting shorter. I notice the heart in my chest getting heavy. And both of my lungs getting older. I notice our bodies together. God  I just want that forever. When we die. Let's die alone  die alone. That way only you and I. Will know where we go  where we go (where we go). Maybe we'll be alright and maybe we won't  maybe we won't. When we die  when we die. Let's just go home. When we die  die alone. Ooh  ooh. Be alright. When we die  die alone. When we die  let's go home.EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 SayWeCanFly ,Beautiful Things,"Talk goes by and every day I throw up my pills cause they don't kill the pain The only thing that severs my chain Is hoping that someone might feel the same And advices I have only bring me to shame The blood on my hands only keeps me awake And the answer is gone but my question remains ""Am I crazy or am I the only one who's sane?"" Because I'm honestly happier when I'm sad When I'm alone at least I know that I have my friends And if the beautiful things come to an end At least I know that I'm not dead A living room made of broken glass I get older but I swear that time doesn't pass The only thing that caries me through Is hoping that someone is hurting too And advices I have are my only friends But they choke me until all my faith is dead The body I have only lasts till it's gone So after I die did I even exist at all? Because I'm honestly happier when I'm sad When I'm alone at least I know that I have my friends And if the beautiful things come to an end At least I know that I'm not dead And maybe some day when the stars are dead We'll fall in love with the earth again And maybe some day when the earth is dead We'll fall in love with ourselves again And maybe some day when the stars are dead We'll fall in love with the earth again And maybe some day when the earth is dead Well maybe we will wish that we'd done things better  And maybe some day when the earth is dead We'll fall in love with ourselves again And we'll fall in loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

 SayWeCanFly ,The Chase,I tried everything but everything was not enough for me  wore myself thin  I couldn't find a way to fix it. Walked a fragile line between my body and my design. Broke my fragile spine  but I won't last alone this time. I  I won't  I won't. I  I won't  I won't. Found myself in the water up to my knees. Time won't slow down for nothin'  not even for me. Lost my soul in the chase now it ain't worth a thing and I know I was wrong to believe that the stars ever fell down for me. I gave everything but everything was taken from me  sold my spirit for poison and a happy ending. Let the devil in  eventually he'll give you something. Share your secrets  eventually you'll learn to love him. I  I won't  I won't (love him so). I  I won't  I won't. Found myself in the water up to my knees. Time won't slow down for nothin'  not even for me. Lost my soul in the chase now it ain't worth a thing. And I know I was wrong to believe that the stars ever fell down for me.

I never thought that I would come back to you  to be honest I am nothing without you. I hope that there's a chance that you can forgive me now  my years alone have taught me very well. I hope that you can hear it in my voice  my intentions  they are honest... I wish that you could see it in my eyes... I can't live to see this die. There comes a time when I'm alone and I am thinking about you  it happens almost every night. And the world as I know it has never been the same place without you in my life. And now it's time to admit that I have always been there  always been scared  now I'm right here. I need to tell you that I finally found myself  I found my way out from hell.

I hope that you can hear it in my voice  my intentions  they are honest... I wish that you could see it in my eyes... I can't live to see this die.EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The key was hidden in the loneliness As I searched around the dark and found a light.. As you carried it away  I was forced to realize That I had taken all we had And it was never to be seen again You had strength and I had time but that's no excuse For me to stab you right in the back And the worst part is all you ever did was break your back for me...

 SayWeCanFly ,The Last Song,What's new is new But that's almost impossible to understand When all I've known for quite some time Is how to hold onto you What's done is done  that's what they say But what happens when it won't go away Like a raincloud Hovering over a sunny day And right now I am jealous of the moon So care free  and so content I wish I could shine as bright as you No matter what was in my head This is my last time wondering If this connection was meant to be Or meant to come apart Like the stitching on a broken heart This is my first time losing a part of me But I've come to terms with things  you see And this is the last song I'm ever gonna write for you Nothing gold can stay  they say When its too good to be true I disagree whole heartedly Cause I could have kept you But I chose to walk a different path It lead me to a loss But I'm going to man up And get my god-damned point across! This is my last time wondering If this connection was meant to be Or meant to come apart Like the stitching on a broken heart This is my first time losing a part of me But I've come to terms with things  you see This is the last song I'm ever gonna write for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 SayWeCanFly ,That Stretch Of Highway,Place yourself in my skin Desperate for the one who kept you whole As I tore myself to pieces And threw them out the window There was no chance of picking them back up The moonlight seeping through Isn't half as bad as the sunlight illustrating you The numbers on the clock will merge together To create a loop of neverending hell Months ago I died Now the rest is just a car ride Back into my grave I'm coming home On that stretch of highway As ghosts line the road On either side of my window But what scares me the most It the one right next to me The empty back seat Place yourself in my shoes Barely hanging on to what is real Because fiction seems much better at this point in time So why not act like I can choose what happens next? All the road lines and road signs No longer mean a thing They've been covered up with cloudy visions Of the past Months ago I died Now the rest is just a car ride Back into my grave I'm coming home On that stretch of highway As ghosts line the road On either side of my window But what scares me the most It the one right next to me The empty back seatEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Everything that you've ever dreamed of Disappearing when you wake up But there's nothing to be afraid of Even when the night changes It will never change  baby  it will never change  baby It will never change  me and you201EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 One Direction ,Zayn and Louis - marijuana controversy,"Louis and Zayn leave the underground car park as they head to the stadium for the concert: Minder: Well we got a full chicken.. we can take this to Jamaica  we don’t have anything in Jamaica set up Unknown male: Are we allowed to talk contraband in this? Louis: Yes of course. That’s what it’s about... Where’s the lighter? Can anybody pass me a lighter please? I want to light up. You got a lighter? After much searching  Louis can be seen lighting up and heard coughing Louis: So here we are  leaving Peru. Joint lit. Happy days... What do you think Zayn? About that kind of content? Zayn: I think it’s very controversial Louis sees a police motorbike rider escorting their convoy Louis: ‘That’s the police. That’s the po po... Nice. I’m trying to blow it into the camera. Smokescreen baby!... That’s just Zayn warming up there before the show. Zayn takes his job very seriously. He makes sure he goes through a two-hour intense warm up regime before every show  just to get himself in the zone. One very  very important factor to Zayn’s warm up  of course is Mary Jane herself. In fact I’m presenting it to him now for some fantastic singing Louis passes Zayn the roll up cigarette Louis: How is it Zayn? Zayn: Nice Louis: That’s the po po. One nil Louis starts filming out the window Louis: Get a bit of the culture. How’s that kind of culture? Zayn: It’s great culture this. It’s going to be even greater culture when we get to Jamaica Member of crew: I just got an update. We got chicken in Chile Zayn: Chicken in Chile! Chile chicken Louis: Yeh baby. That’s the po po. Two nil Louis puts on an exaggerated dopey voice and sways the camera around: Louis: Fucking ‘ell bro  I’m chillin. Oh my God bro. My ‘ed’s a wreck Louis: It’s green only! Nig! Louis: I’m just wondering now. I’m sitting here in Peru wondering will this come back to me? Who knows? Maybe  maybe not Another police bike passes: Louis: One nil bitch! Look at this bitch... He’s having a look. He’s thinking. I’m sure I can smell an illegal substance in there. And he’s hit the nail on the head Zayn: Carl showed... me Kid Rock’s last book. And it’s about twice the size. Hard back. Black. Simple writing. No bullshit.No like ‘My favourite colour’s blue.. And all just sick pictures Louis is passed the roll up by a crew member and zooms in on it: Louis: Ooo Stubbsy! Zayn: “Every time you look in it you just think 'fuck I’ve never seen that picture.' That’s a bad photo...instead of boring crap. Louis: “Yeah I know  same old crap that I’m sure the fans are bored of reading.” Zayn: ""They want to know what we're up to now man."" Talking about the Kid Rock book Zayn says: “He’s smoking a J in one of the pictures Louis and he’s got a gold ring on his middle finger  which is a bid weird  but  aside from that he’s sticking his middle finger up with a J in his mouth  and that's one of the pictures in the book. Louis: “Sick.”5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

 Carrie Underwood ,Praying For Time,These are the days of the open hand They will not be the last Look around now  These are the days of the beggars and the choosers This is the year of the hungry man Whose place is in the past Hand in hand with ignorance and legitimate excuses  The rich declare themselves poor And most of us are not sure If we have too much but we’ll take our chances ‘Cause God stopped keeping score  I guess somewhere along the way He must have let us all out to play And turned his back And all God’s children Crept out the back door And its hard to love There's so much to hate Hanging onto hope When there is no hope to speak of And the wounded skies above Say its much too late Oh maybe we should all be praying for time This is the year of the empty hand Oh you hold on to what you can And charity is a coat you wear twice a year  These are the days of the guilty man The television takes a stand And you find that what was over there Is over here So you scream from behind your door Say what's mine is mine and not yours I may have too much But I’ll take my chances cause God stopped keeping score And you’ll cling to the things they sold you Did you cover your eyes when they told you That he can't come back ‘Cause he has no children To come back for  And its hard to love when there's so much to hate And hanging onto hope When there is no hope to speak of And the wounded skies above Say its much  much too late Mm  well maybe we should all be praying for timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Did it come from your daddy and mama? Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio? That feels so right Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson? Tell me what got ya  I just gotta know Me  I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt Waiting for the fall to finally come along So I can grab my gun and get my outside on Step side cover down in peanut dust Friday night spotlight  and that was us It might not have been you  but I can't judge Just be proud of what makes you country  Might be from a city or a little farm town Whatever kind of square that you drove around Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down? You know you gotta let it out  I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve On a no cab tractor hauling them bales Backing in boats  fishing limb lines Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines Step side cover down in peanut dust Friday night spotlight  and that was us It might not have been you  but I ain't judging And just be proud of what makes you country Whatever makes you country You do your kind of country They doing they kind of country I do my kind of country Whatever makes us country1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Luke Bryan ,Rain is a Good Thing,My daddy spent his life looking up at the sky He'd cuss  kick the dust  saying son it's way too dry It clouds up in the city  the weather man complains But where I come from  rain is a good thing  Rain makes corn  corn makes whiskey Whiskey makes my baby  feel a little frisky Back roads are bogging up  my buddies pile up in my truck We hunt our hunnies down  we take them into town Start washing all our worries down the drain Rain is a good thing  Aren’t nothing like a kiss out back in the barn Ringing out our soaking clothes  riding out a thunderstorm When tin roof gets to talking  that's the best love we made Yeah where I come from  rain is a good thing  Rain makes corn  corn makes whiskey Whiskey makes my baby  feel a little frisky Back roads are bogging up  my buddies pile up in my truck We hunt our hunnies down  we take them into town Start washing all our worries down the drain Rain is a good thing Farmer Johnson does a little dance Creeks on the rise  roll up your pants Country girls  they want to cuddle Kids out playing in a big mud puddle  Rain makes corn  corn makes whiskey Whiskey makes my baby  feel a little frisky Back roads are bogging up  my buddies pile up in my truck We hunt our hunnies down  we take them into town Start washing all our worries down the drain Rain is a good thing  Rain is a good thing Rain is a good thing Rain is a good thing6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 Luke Bryan ,Good Directions,"I was sitting there  selling turnips on a flat-bed truck Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up She had to be thinking this is where rednecks come from She had ""Hollywood"" written on her license plate She was lost and looking for the Interstate Needing directions and I was the man for the job  I told her  ""Way up yonder past the caution lights There's a little country store with an old coke sign You gotta stop and ask ""Miss"" Bell For some of her sweet tea Then a left will take you to the Interstate But a right will bring you right back here to me""  I was sitting there  thinking about her pretty face Kicking myself for not catching her name I threw my hat and thought  ""You fool  it could have been love"" I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down She probably didn't like me anyhow So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust  I told her  ""Way up yonder past the caution lights There's a little country store with an old coke sign You gotta stop and ask ""Miss"" Bell For some of her sweet tea Then a left will take you to the Interstate But a right will bring you right back here to me"" Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me Or am I really seeing what I think I see The woman of my dreams coming back to me (Yeah)  She went way up yonder past the caution light Don't know why  but something felt right When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell For some of her sweet tea Momma gave her a big ole glass And sent her right back here to me Thank God for good directions and turnip greens3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Every little scratch on that CD Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then Baby  hop in  we can take it  Way  way back Find that no-name road Cross those boxcar tracks Where we used to go And lay it way  way  back Let the moonshine through Kissing you like yesterday Like it wasn't all that way  way back Way  way back Like it wasn't all that way  way back Way  way back3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 Luke Bryan ,What Country Is,There's a house fly swimming in my sweet tea Hey darling pass another Kerr jar to me Butter dripping off a biscuit  baby better take a bite Cantaloupe thumps like it's finally ripe Box fan on a lawn chair sucking in swamp air Two hundred mile marker signs from nowhere That's what country is  It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall It's a hideaway bed in an old horse stall Two kids getting caught stealing a Boone's farm kiss It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton It's a Jimmie Rodgers song that was long forgotten It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips That's what country is  When the sun starts slipping from the delta sky And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank 'Bout an hour 'til we feel the first catfish yank Barefoot cane pole waving at the riverboats And when they're gone  take a dip in the moon glow That's what country is It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall It's a hideaway bed in an old horse stall Two kids getting caught stealing a Boone's farm kiss It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips That's what country is  It ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture It's cars pulling over for a no-cab tractor It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips No  it can't be bought  it's something you're born with That's what country is That's what country is That's what country is That's what country isEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 Luke Bryan ,I Don’t Know How To Pronounce Gyro,Hey  you want some lunch? I'm buying Yeah man  I'm starving. What are you getting? I'll have the falafel plate  please. How about you? The uh  you know the uh  that thing there (I can't see  which one?) Um  the brown stuff that you  uh  you know  it's... Man  man I'm good Are you kidding me? What's going on man  you okay? Not exactly  I was born in Southwest Georgia Always tried to make my daddy proud But of all the things I've learned there Never learned how to say that word out loud I just want something to eat Made with a vertical rotisserie of lamb meat  I think I know just what you're going through The way they spelled that gosh darn word seems like a trap It's just lamb meat and other stuff rolled up in a pita I wish they'd just called it a lamb tzatziki wrap I could eat a thousand ounces If I just knew how to pronounce it Is it gee-ro  jyro  here-o  or yai-ro? Never been filled with so much doubt Is it gwy-ro  ga-hee-ro  yurro  or worbtse? We can safely rule that last one out  I can't believe I don't know how to say I eat so many that you'd really think I would Well my friend it looks like we're in a pickle Actually a pickle on a wrap sounds pretty good Well always thought I was a pretty cultured dude Been to the Taj Mahal  the Great Wall  and the Louvre I'm fluent in Italian and efficient in Croatian But when it comes to pronunciation of this particular word... I'm an abomination  Is it gyro? Is it gyro? I'll ask my friend from Kairo He's usually pretty good with this stuff Or maybe I'll just mumble it when I place my order (Not so fast  I caught your bluff) Well  uh  how would you pronounce it then? (Gyro)  It is gyro  it is gyro Now I know it's gyro The truth is so delicious to find No more fearo  you're a hero Cause now I know it's gyro I finally got some piece of mind We finally got some piece of mind I'll take one gyro please (You got it  buddy) Um  can I change that actually I'd love a shish keabob with a little extra humusEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Luke Bryan ,Too Damn Young,"We met down at the floating dock She snuck out scared  she might get caught We were nervous  but it was worth it There was no such thing as consequence With her in my arms it finally made sense In that moonlight  I saw her tan lines  Every time my feet are dangling in the water I can't help but think about her Lying there with her wet hair Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care That old wooden dock was warm on our backs T-shirt for a pillow and just like that She kissed me like she meant forever We were too damn young to know any better  The fog rolled in  she said ""I'd better go"" She took my t-shirt and wore it home A memory  a souvenir she could keep So I stayed and watched that sunrise Like it was waking up my life To what love was  I can still see us Every time my feet are dangling in the water I can't help but think about her Lying there with her wet hair Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care That old wooden dock was warm on our backs T-shirt for a pillow and just like that She kissed me like she meant forever We were too damn young to know any better  Every time my feet are dangling in the water I can't help but think about her Lying there with her wet hair Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care That old wooden dock was warm on our backs T-shirt for a pillow and just like that She kissed me like she meant forever We were too damn young to know any better  We were too damn young to know any better1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

 Luke Bryan ,We Rode in Trucks,Down where I was born was heaven on earth The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright We raised cotton  corn  a little cane  and kids You either lived on a farm or wish you did Jesus always walked close by our side Where I grew up  we rode in trucks  There's a lot about life you can learn on a bus How to lie  how to fight  how to kiss  how to cuss The closer we sat to the back  the smarter we got We were poor  we were ugly  we were all best friends Wide-eyed  baptized  and still wanting to sin Thank God we get more than just one shot Where I grew up  we rode in trucks  That's us  hauling hay in the field with the radio on That's us  heading straight into town when the work was done In my mind  I can still see us now  riding down Buck Island Road It wasn't that long ago  We thought tobacco and beer in a can Was all it would take to be like our old man But I saw how it made my momma cry It was hunting and fishing and football games Then it was girls  and everything changed  in our lives Falling in and out of love  we rode in trucks That's us with our tailgates down in the parking lot That's us with mud on our tires when it rained a lot In my mind  I can still see us now  riding down Buck Island Road It wasn't that long ago  it's a part of my soul. Yeah  Down where I was born  was heaven on earth The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright Where I grew up  we rode in trucksEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Luke Bryan ,I Knew You That Way,The secret way long shadows bleed into the night The Desperate way leaves in the fall hold colors tight The way that thunder knows the taste of summer rain I knew you that way The way that cool mountain water dances down to the sea Bound by something strong but still so wild and free It gives into the passion of the pair that takes I knew you that way  I held you closer than I had a right to hold But the only thing that time can't take away Is I knew you that way  The way that skin on skin can start a crazy fire That no one sees but burns all night long with desire The quiet easing love that makes a woman want to stay I knew you that way  I held you closer than I had a right to hold But the only thing that time can't take away Is I knew you that way The holy way that love knows it should never end The sacred way that stars got sailors home again Like teardrops know the words to amazing grace I knew you that way I knew you that way I knew you that wayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Luke Bryan ,Small Town Favorite,How do you turn a scholarship down Tear up a ticket  already punched And watch a dream die? Who is going to tell me how To face Daddy And watch Mamma cry? Have I thrown my future away? Played my last football game? It all seems so strange How in just one night Your whole life can change  Wish this old John Deere had wings And this cotton row was an airstrip Straight out of here Wish this high noon Georgia sun Could melt what is been done Make it disappear If I could leave  I would be gone But that is just one more thing done wrong By this small town favorite son  By fall they are all going to know Our little secret My baby holds inside By then she will be starting to show And I will be the husband To a shotgun bride I already miss that sound The marching bands and the cheering crowds Stuck here in this red dirt ground Knowing I  I let everybody down  That high noon Georgia sun Cannot melt what is been done Girl  I will be right here I do not know much about life But I know what is right For this small town favorite sonEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Luke Bryan ,Chevrolet,I am going to find a way to love again I am on the winning stretch of a losing end Foot on the gas  I am freedom bound I have got the morning sun at my back  and I am inspired Nothing can slow me down She used to get me I was held back by her memory  Let the highway sing A song of a new beginning  keep these wheels a spinning Going to hammer down While the distant sky is waking  light behind me is breaking I found a better way  in the form of a Chevrolet  A strange reminder of how I walked a step behind her Back here in the shadows of an 18-wheeler Where I am heading I still do not know But I caught the wind of an AM station Blaring on my radio I am not looking back I never thought I could say that.

She is gone and found her way To another life in a better place But I hear she is missing me You will can have this town  Bet there is not a single place to fish up there No small talk or sweet tea  but I do not care It is going to be worth everything I have to leave When I feel her loving arms on me Right there is the Interstate And I am turning on Looks like I am gone You will can have this town And what I do not grab on my way out Because the only thing I need Is not here. She is gone and found her way To another life in a better place But I hear she is missing me You will can have this town  Everybody says I will be back Brother do not hold your breath on that Because as long as she is not here  You will can have this town And what I do not grab on my way out Because the only thing I need Is not here. She is gone and found her way To another life in a better place But I hear she is missing me You will can have this townEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
 Luke Bryan ,Your Goodbye Wasn’t Good Enough,Standing right there  awake and aware I heard the words right off your lips The meaning was clear  I saw the tears But somehow the message did not click The losing you part  the break in my heart  just did not stick  Girl your goodbye was not good enough I am as into you as I ever was If you had done it right  then why should not I love Must be because  your goodbye was not good enough  Some look in your eye  says there is still time Maybe there is one more last chance left What you did not say  when you turned away Made me hang on by one more thread That shadow of hope  that whisper of smoke  is still in my head  Girl your goodbye was not good enough I am as into you as I ever was If you had done it right  then why should not I love Must be because  your goodbye was not Good enough to make me see  I do not need you  and you do not need me EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I must've forgot  you can't trust me I'm open a moment and closed when you show it Before you know it  I'm lost at sea And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds You should take my life  you should take my soul  You are surrounding  all my surroundings Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain You are surrounding  all my surroundings Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes And I'll be holding on to you And I'll be holding on to you  Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin' 'Cause the next moment before you know it Time is slowin' and it's frozen still And the windowsill looks really nice  right? You think twice about your life  it probably happens at night  right? Fight it  take the pain  ignite it Tie a noose around your mind  loose enough to breathe fine And tie it to a tree tell it  ""You belong to me This ain't a noose  this is a leash And I have news for you  you must obey me!"" You are surrounding  all my surroundings Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain You are surrounding  all my surroundings Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes  Entertain my faith  entertain my faith Entertain my faith  entertain my faith Entertain my faith  entertain my faith Entertain my faith  entertain my faith Entertain my faith  entertain my faith  Lean with it  rock with it  when we gonna stop with it?

And could it be true that some could be tempted To use this mistake as a form of aggression? A form of succession? A form of a weapon? Thinking ""I'll teach them"" Well  I'm refusing the lesson It won't resonate in our minds I'm not disrespecting what was left behind Just pleading that it does not get glorified Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high Find your grandparents or someone of age Pay some respects for the path that they paved To life  they were dedicated Now  that should be celebrated162EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I don't wanna be the one  be the one who has the Sun's blood on my hands  I'll tell the moon Take this weapon forged in darkness Some see a pen  I see a harpoon  I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight Why am I not scared in the morning? I don't hear those voices calling I must have kicked them out  I must have kicked them out I swear I heard demons yelling Those crazy words they were spelling They told me I was gone  they told me I was gone  But I'll tell 'em  ""Why won't you let me go? Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant"" Please tell 'em  you have no plans for me I will set my soul on fire  what have I become? I'll tell 'em On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake As the trees  they await  and clouds anticipate The start of a day when we put on our face A mask that portrays that we don't need grace On the eve of a day that is bigger than us But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead Desperately yelling  ""There's something we need!"" I'm not free  I asked forgiveness three times Same amount that I denied  I three-time MVP'd this crime I'm afraid to tell you who I adore  won't tell you who I'm singing towards Metaphorically  I'm a whore  and that's denial number four  I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight Why am I not scared in the morning? I don't hear those voices calling I must have kicked them out  I must have kicked them out I swear I heard demons yelling Those crazy words they were spelling They told me I was gone  they told me I was gone  But I'll tell 'em  ""Why won't you let me go?

And then I cracked open my box  someone must have picked the lock A little light revealed the spot where my fingernails had fought Then I pushed it open more  pushing up against the door Then I sat up off the floor  and found the breath I was searching for Then there were three men up front  all I saw were backs of heads And then I asked  ""Am I alive and well  or am I dreaming dead?"" Then one turned around to say ""We're driving toward the morning sun Where all your blood is washed away and all you did will be undone.""  I said  ""Don't be afraid"" I said  ""Don't be afraid"" Oh  oh57EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I will fly with no hope  no fear And the ground taunts my wings Plummet as I sing  plummet as I sing  All we are is an isle of flightless birds  we find our worth in giving birth and stuff We're lining our homes against winding roads and we think the going is tough We pick songs to sing  remind us of things that nobody cares about And honestly  we're probably more suicidal than ever now If you decide to live by what you think's wrong and what's right Believe me  you'll begin to wish you were sleeping Your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry But if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe We can take apart our very heart and the light will set us free I am cold  can you hear? I will fly with no hope  no fear And the ground taunts my wings Plummet as I sing  plummet as I I am cold  can you hear? I will fly with no hope  no fear And the ground taunts my wings Plummet as I sing  plummet as I  How frustrating and so degrading His time  we're wasting as time will fly by And the sky will cry as light is fading And He is waiting  oh  so patiently While we repeat the same routine as we will please comfortability And please think about why you can't sleep in the evening And please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking Your soul knows good and evil  your soul knows both sides And it's time you pick your battle  and I promise you  this is mine I promise you  this is mine89EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

 Twenty One Pilots ,March to the Sea,"There's miles of land in front of us And we're dying with every step we take We're dying with every breath we make And I'll fall in line A stranger's back is all I see He's only a few feet in front of me And I'll look left and right sometimes But I'll fall in line  No one looks up anymore 'Cause you might get a raindrop in your eye And Heaven forbid they see you cry As we fall in line And about this time of every year The line will go to the ocean pier And walk right off into the sea And then we fall asleep  And as we near the end of land And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand I ask myself the question why I fall in line And then out of the corner of my eye I see a spaceship in the sky And hear a voice inside my head ""Follow me instead"" ""Follow me instead"" ""Follow me""  Then the wages of war will start Inside my head with my counterparts And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase ""This line's the only way"" And then I start down the sand My eyes are focused on the end of land But again the voice inside my head says  ""Follow me instead"" ""Follow me instead"" ""Follow me"" ""Follow me instead"" ""Follow me instead"" ""Follow me instead"" ""Follow me instead"" ""Follow me instead""  Take me up  seal the door I don't want to march here anymore I realize that this line is dead So I'll follow you instead So then you put me back in my place So I might start another day And once again I will be In a march to the sea45EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

 Twenty One Pilots ,Dmaorg.info Transcriptions,"Uploaded 4/20/2018: cla_ncy-988-06MOON_18_-1.jpg The perplexities of the Dema horizon didn't occur to me until my ninth year. It was then that I began to contemplate the existential  and decide what type of impression I wanted my life to make. Naturally  to fuel my hope  I looked out upon the distance of the land that had cultivated me  only this time with new awareness of the obstruction that my youthful ignorance had allowed me to overlook. Was it there the whole time? How had I not seen something so obvious? I am reminded of the moment daily  as the realization directly collides with a unique hope for my own future. As a child  I looked upon Dema with wonder  today  I am wrought with frustration  as I spend each day squinting for a glimpse of the top of the looming wall that has kept us here. It was upon my ninth year that I learned that Dema wasn’t my home. This village  after all of this time  was my trap. Before I became realized  I had deep affection for Dema. There was a wonderful structure to the city that put my cares to rest. Streets and locations were dependable  and the responsibilities of the day seemed to be accomplished with minimal effort. Once a task was taught and understood  we delighted in our ability to complete our obligations timely  and felt secure in knowing tomorrow's duties would be accomplished with the same efficiency. We all worked to represent our bishop with honor  and knew that each inhabitant of our region had a like-minded dedication to consistency. Keons embodied the spirit of this dedication. Of Dema's nine bishops  Keons was reserved as unwavering and forthright  possessing the ability to achieve focus that was rare for most in our region. We all admired his  and felt honored to be inhabitants of his region. While we had heard legend of the ruthlessness of other bishops  Keons possessed a stoic demeanor unlike anyone I had ever met  and we were all proud to serve. - Clancy Uploaded 5/9/2018: 017_07MOON_07.jpg To refer to Dema as m home has never felt accurate. Dema  t me  has simply been the place that I’ve existed  or  the 'slot' they've put me in. I've heard stories abot the ide of ""home "" and its depiction has always seemed warm fom the storytller's decription. here was a romantc ownership of the pace they inhabited that I admired  but coud never relate to. Thi place  my pace  however  sems devoid of the romance and wondr that the old stories tell. But somewhere between the iron order and fallible recison of Dema  a hum of woder exists. It's this quiet wonder that my mind tends to ets lost in. This hope of discovery alone has birthed a new version of myself; A better version  I hope  that will find a way to experience what's beyond these colossal walls. - Clancy Uploaded 7/1/2018: _e_sr__eve_r_.jpg A lifeless light surrounds us each night. Never could I imagine that something so luminous could feel so dark. I’ts this glow that reminds us of the dreamless existence we’ve been sentenced to. But what I call a sentence  others accept as normalcy. How did they so efficiently eradicate the dreams within us? When the bishops instituted Vialism as mandate  they effectively reversed the hope that many arrived with. Am I the only one who realizes that we've been lied to? Am I the only one not afraid of the notion that the nine have hijacked our trust  and extinguished the hope that once motivated our existence? We used to close our eyes and picture a better life  now this city is full of dry eyes caught in a trance of obedience  devoid of any trace of an identity. The only significant light I’ve seen has been in the eyes of of those smeared - such a curious sight  to see bright eyes strangled by the darkness of bishop hands. As their penance fades  so dims their memory of something more. My hope of something more is all I have in this rigid tomb  and I will not let it die. - Clancy Uploaded 7/5/2018: _he_a_vy_.jpg They're asleep. The night took forever to arrive  and now we're almost ready. We've studied the watchers  and know that there’s no chance that we can step through unnoticed. So  instead of trying to hide ourselves  we'll make sure that all of us are noticed. It's been one year since the last convocation  and tomorrow's Annual Assemblage of Glorified will be the biggest spectacle this concrete coffin of a city has seen all year. If we time it right  we'll divert the attention of the watchers and finally take the step through. We've had no contact  but we're hoping the other side will be able to find a way in. We're not sure of the breach location  but we are willing to risk being smeared in order to find it. We know that we must go lower  and wait for the torches. They've never seen anything quite like this  and by morning  everything will be different. I'm terrified and excited  all at the same time. They don't control us. - Clancy Uploaded 7/8/2018: _note.gif I've made it out. I feel weightless. I know that place had always held me down  but for the first time  I can feel the unity that I had hoped for. It's been three nights now  and my breathing has changed - it's slower  and more full. It's like the air out here is actually worth taking in. I can see it back in the distance  and I'd be lying if I said that it wasn't constantly on my mind. I wish I could turn that fear off  but maybe the further I go  the less that fear will affect me. I feel betrayed by what I assumed was home. If I ever end up back there  I won't be able to look at it the same way. They are asleep. They're so sure that they know the truth  and carry on throughout their day with the same meaningless tasks. They've forgotten to look up  and to look outward  to understand that this isn't about 'in there.' This is about 'out here.' This new world surrounds me. I used to think the walls back home were massive- these green cliffs engulf me  and place me right in the middle- Trench is quite precarious at times  and it's easy to grow weary. But it's real  and it's true  and I'd much rather endure reality than to mindlessly be obedient to a life that someone else created for me. I've obsessed about this world for so long  that it feels more like home than anything I've experienced. Somehow  in this vast openness  I feel more protected than ever. The landscape feels endless  and I've found myself walking for hours without any true evidence of getting further down. But I've seen plants and colors out here that I'm not sure I've witnessed before. There's a beauty in the strangest places - and the curiosity of what's next continues to motivate me. I wonder who else is out here. If what i assumed inside is true  there's got to be more like me. Sometimes I'll feel a presence  only to look up and see nothing. It's just another thing that I'm afraid of that also excites me. It all just confirms all of the things that I hoped to be true for all of this time. I am out here and I am very alive. I'm sometimes scared  but always discovering something new  and I will not stop. Cover me! - Clancy Uploaded 7/18/2018: unalone.gif I can't believe what I just saw. I'm still trying to understand. This whole time I thought I was all alone - a single soul in this vast unknown world. But a few days into this trek  I looked down to see a figure headed the same way I was. I've tucked myself in these caves and crevices  trying my best to keep hidden  but he was out in the open  making his exhausting journey right down the middle of Trench. I was curious enough to follow alongside the path with him. He seemed unaffected by the fear of the unknown - the fear that tends to cripple me. To him  the terrain seemed familiar  as if he had been out here before. While lost in my curiosity  they appeared. I had heard about them back in Dema  but to my knowledge  the stories were merely myth. Ten  twenty  and then what seemed to be a hundred Banditos appeared upon the cliffs  all looking down at him. He only stopped for a moment to look back up at them  and then continued on his way. His energy changed  and I wasn't sure if he was frightened or encouraged by their ominous presence. They warned him of what was about to come. It was a blur. First seeing the figure  then the Banditos  only to now have my eyes opened to the oncoming Bishop upon a white horse drawing closer in the distance. The figure halted  and waited. When the Bishop stopped  I was sure he looked up  directly at me  so I hid deeper back in a cave. The presence of the robed rider seemed to paralyze the man. He stood still as he was approached  powerless as the outstretched hands smeared his neck. I had never seen a Bishop possess a power like this. Keons had always seemed gentle and warm - this bishop  at least out here  seemed like something else. So I ran  and I've been running for as long as my legs and lungs can handle. Maybe this note will be my proof that what I witnessed was not a dream. A million questions race through my brain. Am I not the only one traveling through Trench? I'll travel a little farther  and maybe I'll get a moment of rest tonight. I may have made a mistake  leaving. This spot  between two places  is beginning to feel like an endless and hopeless abyss. At least Dema is a place that I know  and at times like this  I miss a lot about what I know. This will all be much tougher than I imagined. Nothing out here is familiar. I've witnessed the presence of others for the first time today  and I feel more alone than ever. Cover me. - Clancy Uploaded 1/22/2019: 17-35.4527.jpg I can't face this page for long enough to write what I'm truly feeling. I am only wrought with more questions: Questions about what I assumed to be true  questions about what my own path is  and the question that has plagued my every night that I lie here  back in the city: Did I give up? The force I saw between him and his bishop seemed tense to me  and frightening. But the memory of that exchange has had time to fester and replay in my mind long enough that I'm questioning if I even remembered it correctly. I assumed the bishop was forcefully retrieving his subject  but now I wonder if the bishop was actually trying to save him  but he refused. I stayed out there for five days after I watched it happened. I haven't seen him since. Maybe he got away  and was still out in Trench with me. Maybe the bishop chased him down  and brought him home. Home? Did I just call this place ´home?` After all of the endless beauty that I saw out there  I am now convincing myself that I'm actually better off within these confines? I admit  It was more difficult than I expected. Nothing could have prepared me for how much the ´unknown´ can consume me. Vast landscapes and endless possibilities  yet coupled with endless danger. I became anxious. I became tired. I became hungry. Every step I took seemed harder than the last  jumping from jagged rucky step to step  or pulling myself through thick forest – it all became debilitating  and I was sure that I couldn't go on. Keons approached as the sun rose one morning. I wasn't scared. I was relieved. After all that he had taught me  his presence was the most comforting moment that I had in days  and I couldn't help but be happy to see him. In true Keon's fashion  he wrapped his arms around me  then put his hands under my face  looked me in the eyes  and then said “Clancy  my child  let's go home.” I've been here for a few weeks now  and while the routines of this world are comforting  and certainly easier than life out there  my mind keeps bouncing between the two places. Which one is home? Are the bishops protecting me  and the torches upon the hilltop dangerous? Or is it the other way around? My dreams pull me from world to world  and I feel lost in between all of it. There is still so much I do not understand. -Clancy11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

 Twenty One Pilots ,Ode to Sleep (Only Skeleton Bones Remain Version),"Time stands still Time stands still There's a metaphor in hand A metaphoric blast wich only few will understand Under clothes  Under skin  Underneath we're all the same For when you remove the tricky tricks Only skeleton bones remain  Only skeleton bones remain  I wake up fine and dandy But then by the time I find it handy To rip my heart apart and start Planning my crash landing I go up  up  up  up  up to the ceiling Then I feel my soul start leaving Like an old man's hair receding I'm pleading  ""Please  oh please!"" On my knees repeatedly asking Why it's got to be like this Is this living free? I don't wanna be the one Be the one to have the sun's blood on my hands I'll tell the moon Take this weapon  forged in darkness Some see a pen  I see harpoon I'll stay awake Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight Why am I not scared in the morning? I don't hear those voices calling I must have kicked them out I must have kicked them out I swear I heard demons yelling Those crazy words they were spelling They told me I was gone They told me I was gone  But I tell 'em Why won't you let me go Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant Please tell 'em You have no plans for me I will set my soul on fire What have I become? I'll tell 'em  On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake As the trees  they await  and clouds anticipate The start of a day when we put on our face A mask that portrays that we don't need grace On the eve of a day that is bigger than us But we open our eyes  cause we're told that we must And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead Desperately yelling  ""There's something we need!"" I'm not free  I asked forgiveness three times Same amount that I denied  I three-time MVP'd this crime I'm afraid to tell you who I adore Won't tell you who I'm singing towards Metaphorically  I'm a whore  and that's denial number four I'll stay awake Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight Why am I not scared in the morning?

They think this thing is a highway If it was our way  we’d have a tempo change every other time change Cause our mind’s changed on what we think is good I wasn’t raised in the hood But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness If it wasn’t for this music I don’t know how I would have fought this Regardless  all these songs I’m hearing are so heartless Don’t trust a perfect person and don’t trust a song that’s flawless  honest There’s a few songs on this record that feel common I’m in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin' In the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency My creativity’s only free when I’m playing shows They say  ""Stay in your lane  boy  lane  boy"" But we go where we want to They think this thing is a highway  highway But will they be alive tomorrow?  I’m sorry if that question I asked last Scared you a bit like a Hazmat  in a gas mask if you ask Zack He’s my brother  he likes when I rap fast But let's backtrack Back to this Who would you live and die for on that list? But the problem is  there’s another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this Forget sanity  forget salary  forget vanity  my morality If you get in between someone I love and me You’re gonna feel the heat of my cavalry All these songs I’m hearing are so heartless Sing (Don’t trust a perfect person and don’t trust a song that’s flawless)  They say  ""Stay in your lane  boy  lane  boy"" But we go where we want to They think this thing is a highway  highway But will they be alive tomorrow?

 Twenty One Pilots ,Lane Boy (Acoustic Version),"They say  ""Stay in your lane  boy  lane  boy"" But we go where we want to They think this thing is a highway  highway But will they be alive tomorrow?  They think this thing is a highway If it was our way  we'd have a tempo change every other time change 'Cause our mind's changed on what we think is good I wasn't raised in the hood But I know a thing or two about pain an' darkness If it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this Regardless  all these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless Don't trust a perfect person an' don't trust a song that's flawless  honest There's a few songs on this record that feel common I'm in constant confrontation with what I want an' what is poppin' In the industry  it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency My creativity's only free when I'm playin' shows  They say  ""Stay in your lane  boy  lane  boy"" But we go where we want to They think this thing is a highway  highway But will they be alive tomorrow? I'm sorry if that question I asked last Scared you a bit like a Hazmat  in a gas mask if you ask Zack He's my brother  he likes when I rap fast But let's backtrack  back to this Who would you live and die for on that list? But the problem is  there's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this Forget sanity  forget salary  forget vanity  my morality If you get in between someone I love an' me You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry All these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless Don't trust a perfect person an' don't trust a song that's flawless  They say  ""Stay in your lane  boy  lane  boy"" But we go where we want to They think this thing is a highway  highway But will they be alive tomorrow? They say  ""Stay in your lane  boy  lane  boy"" But we go where we want to They think this thing is a highway  highway But will they be alive tomorrow?   No  no  no  no No  no  no  no No  no  no  no  no Will they be alive tomorrow? No  no  no  no No  no  no  no No  no  no  no  no Will they be alive tomorrow? They say  ""Stay in your lane  boy  lane  boy"" But we go where we want to They think this thing is a highway  highway But will they be alive tomorrow?

 Maroon 5 ,Harder to Breathe,"How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable So condescending  unnecessarily critical I have the tendency of getting very physical So watch your step  'cause if I do  you'll need a miracle You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here The double vision I was seeing is finally clear You want to stay  but you know very well I want you gone Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on  But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love You'll understand what I mean when I say ""There's no way we're gonna give up"" (Yeah  yeah  yeah) And like a little girl cries in the face Of a monster that lives in her dreams Is there anyone out there? 'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe Is there anyone out there? 'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe  What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head You should know better  you never listened to a word I said Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love You'll understand what I mean when I say ""There's no way we're gonna give up"" (Yeah  yeah  yeah) And like a little girl cries in the face Of a monster that lives in her dreams She said  is there anyone out there? 'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe Is there anyone out there? 'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe  And does it kill? Does it burn? Is it painful to learn That it's me that has all the control? Does it thrill? Does it sting when you feel what I bring And you wish that you had me to hold?  But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love You'll understand what I mean when I say ""There's no way we're gonna give up"" (Yeah  yeah  yeah) And like a little girl cries in the face Of a monster that lives in her dreams Is there anyone out there?

 Maroon 5 ,Nothing Lasts Forever,It is so easy to see Dysfunction between you and me We must free up these tired souls Before the sadness kills us both I tried and tried to let you know I love you  but I'm letting go It may not last  but I don't know Just don't know  If you don't know  then you can't care And I show up  but you're not there But I'm waiting and you want to Still afraid that I will desert you  Everyday With every worthless word We get more far away The distance between us makes it so hard to stay But nothing lasts forever But be honest  babe It hurts  but it may be the only way  A bed that's warm with memories Can heal us temporarily But misbehaving only makes The ditch between us so damn deep Built a wall around my heart Never let it fall apart Strangely  I wish secretly It would fall down while I'm asleep If you don't know  then you can't care And I show up  but you're not there But I'm waiting and you want to Still afraid that I will desert you  baby  Everyday With every worthless word We get more far away The distance between us makes it so hard to stay But nothing lasts forever But be honest  babe It hurts  but it may be the only way  But we have not hit the ground Doesn't mean we're not still falling  oh I want so bad to pick you up But you're still too reluctant to accept my help What a shame I hope you find somewhere to place the blame But until then  the fact remains  Everyday With every worthless word We get more far away The distance between us makes it so hard to stay Nothing lasts forever But be honest  babe It hurts  but it may be the only way Everyday With every worthless word We get more far away The distance between us makes it so hard to stay But nothing last forever But be honest  babe It hurts  but it may be the only way4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Do you remember how it felt when I touched you? Oh  'cause I remember very well And how long has it been Since someone you let in Has given what I gave to you? And at night when you sleep Do you dream I would be there Just for a minute or two  do you?  You ain't ever coming back to me That's not how things were supposed to be You take my hand just to give it back No other lover has ever done that  Heartache  heartache  I just have so much A simple love with a complex touch And there is nothing you can say or do I called to let you know I'm through with you You ain't ever coming back to me And that's not how things were supposed to be You take my hand just to give it back No other lover has ever done that Heartache heartache I just have so much A simple love with a complex touch And there is nothing you can say or do I called to let you know I'm through I called to let you know I'm through I called to let you know I'm through with you I ain't ever coming back to you4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I’m not fine  I’m in pain It’s harder everyday Maybe we’re better off this way?

 Maroon 5 ,Back At Your Door,"From the moment the lights went off Everything had changed Lie awake in an empty room In my head it all feels the same Like the taste of the day you left That still lingers on my breath And the dampness of tears that left A stain where you had wept All alone with the negligee That still hangs off of my bed I keep meaning to give it away But I just leave it there instead  No need to cry about it I cannot live without it Every time I wind up back at your door Why do you do this to me? You penetrate right through me Every time I wind up back at your door  Three more days 'til I see your face I’m afraid it’s far too much Cook a meal and fix up the place Dial your number  hang it up If I took you for granted I apologize for acting tough You’re my reason for living And there’s no way I’m giving up  oh No need to cry about it I cannot live without it Every time I wind up back at your door Why do you do this to me? You penetrate right through me Every time I wind up back at your door  Now every evening is a bitter fight And I’m eating home alone on a Friday night I know what your friends say ""He's just wasting your love and time"" I will never let you change your mind  No need to cry about it I cannot live without it Every time I wind up back at your door Why do you do this to me? You penetrate right through me Every time I wind up back at your door  No need to cry about it I may just die without it Every time I wind up back at your door Why do you do this to me? You penetrate right through me Every time I wind up back at your door Every time I wind up back at your door Every time I wind up back at your door4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

 Maroon 5 ,Infatuation,Baby  I don’t want to spend my life on trial For something that I did not do And maybe if you stopped and looked around some time I wouldn’t pass right by you Maybe it’s because you are so insecure Maybe you plain don’t care Maybe it’s the chase that really gets me off I fall so when it’s just not there  Burn another bridge  break another heart Try again  it will only fall apart  Infatuation Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me It’s such a shame that you shot me down It would have been nice to be around I’m touching your skin If it’s only a fantasy  then why is it killing me?

Do you wish you were somewhere else? Justified all the things you tried Said that it was all for me  And be near Just for the moment Stay here Never go home Did you know that everything she ever does is for you? So it goes  the story of a broken heart comes true It comes true  Have you learned all the secrets yet? Will you burn by the things I've said? Took the dive just to feel alive But never heard the truth Now I'm in love but I don't know how I'm in pain cause I want it now As I sit watching her eyes close I slowly open mine And be near Just for the moment Stay here Never go home Did you know that everything she ever does is for you? So it goes  the story of a broken heart comes true It comes true  I am so confused by this I know that life is hit or miss Days are stung by too much sun I think that you may be the one  Cover yourself up in me Shrouded in what could have been I will listen to your pain If you listen to me  Did you know that everything she ever does is for you So it goes  as the story of a broken heart comes true Did you know that everything she ever does is for you And I know  the story of a broken heart comes True Come true True It comes true True1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

'Cause I've got a jet back heart And there's a hurricane underneath it Trying to keep us apart I write with a poison pen But these chemicals moving between us Are the reason to start again  Now I'm holding on for dear life (Now I'm holding on for dеar life) There's no way that wе could rewind (There's no way that we could rewind) Maybe there's nothing after midnight That could make you stay But now that I'm broken (Now that I'm broken) And now that you know it (Now that you know it) Caught up in a moment Can you see inside?  'Cause I've got a jet black heart And there's a hurricane underneath it Trying to keep us apart I write with a poison pen But these chemicals moving between us Are the reason to start again  The blood in my veins is made up of mistakes Let's forget who we are and dive into the dark As we burst into color  returning to life  'Cause I've got a jet back heart And there's a hurricane underneath it Trying to keep us apart I write with a poison pen But these chemicals moving between us Are the reason to start again The blood in my veins is made up of mistakes (To start again) Let's forget who we are and dive into the darkEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
