My name is Robert Shiller. I'm teaching a course on Financial Markets. This is a basic course about how finance works in our society. I want to give a sense of the financial theory. But, equally important, I wanted to give a sense of how it's applied. I think this course should be of interest far beyond those people who think they will go into finance or banking. Finance is not about making money, though, in some sense, it is. But I don't see it that way. We all have our purposes. It's part of human nature to settle on some goal or idea for us. Usually, that isn't making money. Making things happen is what I think finance ought to be about. Almost every human activity that's useful and important needs financing. That's what I want to get out of this. I want it to be practical and useful. And, hey, at the same time, I think the theory is beautiful because, to me, it conveys what wonderful things can happen, how people can let their creativity and anything become reality. That's what finance is about, and that's what I' going to convey in this course.
