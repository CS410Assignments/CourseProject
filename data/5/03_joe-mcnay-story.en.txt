All right,
I want to tell you another story. This is a Yale story. Joe McNay, I think he was a Yale graduate. The class of 1954 was celebrating
the 25th anniversary of their graduation, that would be in 1979. And somebody said, this guy,
Joe McNay is a great investor. Why don't we, as a class,
give money to Joe McNay, and just ask him to invest it for 25 years, and turn
it over to Yale University as our gift. But we don't turn it over now,
because apparently they thought that the Yale portfolio was
not managed well at all. And so this is before David Swenson
became the head of the Yale portfolio. So Yale was investing in government
bonds and safe things like that. They couldn't stomach the variation
that you see in investments. But Joe McNay was just this creative guy. And they said hey, you know, this is just
our celebration for our 25th anniversary. We don't care about this 370,000. We want you to invest it for
maximum returns, and you can take chances. We're in the mood. Hey we're all having our beers
together 25 years later. It's It isn't often that investors will
tell that to an investment manager. So, right? You don't say,
if you lose all of it, well, okay. We don't care. But we think you can do it so please try. So, Joe McNay invested it in Walmart
Home Depot and some Internet stocks. [LAUGH] So, he took Walmart, it's like
an Apple corporation, really volatile. He thought,
well they've told me I could do this. And so he gave to Yale University
$90 million, quite a success.
