Who keeps plantin' them kisses on your South Georgia lips Dancin’ in the rain with my hands on your hips Who lays your life out in pretty little rows Who keeps that red dirt between your pretty toes Oh  say my name  let it echo through the holler Who’s your farmer Who’s your John Deere  who’s your cold beer Who’s the arms around you on a four-wheeler flyin’ through a hayfield Who’s your crooked smile in a t-shirt tan Home grown southern charmer Who’s your farmer  Who works harder on lovin’ you than any ol’ hard earned dollar Tell me who’s your farmer Girl come on up here  let me show you how to drop a row marker Tell me who’s your farmer  Say my name  let it echo through the holler Who’s your farmer Aw  who’s your farmerEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy\"}], [{'artist': ' Chris Janson ',

and wrapped it was traveling In the warmth of Maria's small hand She happily gave her last peso On a cage made of rushes and twine She fed it loose corn from the market And watched it grow stronger with time Now the Christmas Eve service was coming And the church shone with tinsel and light And all of the townsfolk brought presents To lay by the manger that night There were diamonds and incense and perfumes In packages fit for a king But for one ragged bird in a small cage Maria had nothing to bring She waited till just before midnight So no one could see her go in And crying she knelt by the manger For her gift was unworthy of Him Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness Maria  what brings you to me If the bird in the cage is your offering Open the door  let me see Though she trembled  she did as he asked her And out of the cage the bird flew Soaring into the rafters On a wing that had healed good as new Just then the midnight bells rang out And the little bird started to sing A song that no words could recapture Whose beauty was fit for a king Now Maria felt blessed just to listen To that cascade of notes sweet and long As her offering was lifted to heaven By the very
