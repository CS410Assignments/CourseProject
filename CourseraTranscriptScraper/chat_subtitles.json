These two kinds of techniques are covered in the tool in this specialization. So, text retrieval on search engines covers text retrieval, and this is necessary to turn big text data into a much smaller but more relevant text data, which are often the data that we need to handle a particular problem or to optimize a particular decision. This course covers text mining which is a second step in this pipeline that can be used to further process the small amount of relevant data to extract the knowledge or to help people digest the text data easily. So the two courses are clearly related, in fact, some of the techniques are shared by both text retrieval and text mining. If you have already taken the text retrieval course, then you might see some of the content being repeated in this text mining course, although we'll be talking about the techniques from a very different perspective. If you have not taken the text retrieval course, it's also fine because this course is self-contained and you can certainly understand all of the materials without a problem. Of course, you might find it beneficial to take both courses and that will give you a very complete set of skills to handle big text data.",
